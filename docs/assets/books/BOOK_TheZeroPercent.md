# Introduction

## Page 1 – Wealth, Education, and the Path to Success

Most people are not entirely sure what they want to do or how to go about accomplishing it. So, they resort to getting an education, as if that's the cure-all to one's wealth aspiration. Graduating high school or college can be a huge accomplishment for most citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nationals in the United States, especially if it means being the first to graduate in the family! Being led to believe that the world's treasures are within arm's reach and so many options for success are now available; however, selecting the right path can be a course in itself.

After all, time is short, and time is money! Just as all people have an innate existential drive to understand who they are and why they are here, they also desire to create generational wealth. Some will be fortunate enough to locate a reputable firm, put in their time, and reach retirement or even learn a trade to one day run a successful business, but for some, not so much. Others have been in the work field with or without secondary education, creating one financial plan after another, renewing paying off student loans and credit card debt repeatedly. For some reason, the debt doesn't go away fast enough to see a difference in life. Life feels stagnant! If only wages covered enough monthly expenses to save enough money to eventually fire the boss and start the right business to earn money needed to pay off debts and finally experience freedom.

## Page 2 – The Two Classes and Business Formation

So how does one start a business? There are two types of classes in the world; the one-percenters or the ninety-nine percenters. Indeed, it is no secret that the best Fortune 500 companies have high-end attorneys who manage the step-by-step setup process for their client's businesses and at a hefty service charge that most people may not immediately be fortunate enough to afford at first. However, vigilance and a never-ending studious mindset position the individuals into the one percenters' realm. Many have the investor mentality and have thought long and hard about joining the 90% of the world's millionaires, who earned their wealth through real estate investing. Overall, people are just tired of the 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, or what has become a more desirable work schedule, the four-tens.

Certainly, time is something that cannot be refunded, and every second deserves to be spent efficiently and by choice. Again time is short, and time is money! Everyone has either thought about going to the banks for cash to consolidate or invest. How the cash is managed with the attached interest is very important. Either borrowers pay the debt and have fun, or borrow to spend for a profit, which in turn pays the debt and a good life. This is what intelligent investors would call "good debt." Everyone who has prepared to enter into a repayment agreement has planned financial strategies before the loan application is approved. Although FICO scores may not be at their best, with high hopes, it should be good enough for the bank to provide funding, right?

## Page 3 – Banking Rejections and Alternative Strategies

Going into the bank can be nerve-racking, whether it's in person with a local banker or via an online application. So many people have experienced bankers explain credit denials with comments such as, "It looks like Transunion and Equifax scores are exceptional; however, the Experian score does not meet our requirements. If a co-signer is available, we may be able to move forward!"

Sounds familiar, right? The uneasy feeling of credit rejection from the bank is a terrible experience. Having to involve a family member or a trustworthy friend to provide their creditworthiness is even worse. If traditional funding fails, then what else is there for a real estate investment deal? Indeed, all beginner real estate investors have scoured online to find many methods of "No Money No Credit" investment strategies from an endless list of real estate gurus. After all, the great Robert Kiyosaki had explained in his writings that real teachers are defined as teachers who practice what they teach. Unlike general public school teachers, their multi-layered degrees qualify them to teach the theory of the subject. In all actuality, generating profits from practical experience is lacking from the public school system teachers and professors. The truth is, no teacher or professor in the secondary or post-secondary education sector will tell their students that they can take today's lesson in class and go out into the world and make a successful profit.

## Page 4 – Real Estate Gurus and Financial Education Failures

Several real estate gurus charge an arm and a leg for their seminars, and worst of all, the reviews from their students alert many people to be aware of a scam or brilliant Ponzi Scheme. The only profit the students have made is a whopping zero. Simultaneously, the appetite for freedom and wealth still grows, while seeing and hearing more millionaires displaying their lavish life or introducing a "buy my money-making course" ad on YouTube, Tic-Tok, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Their success is attractive, but the frustration from the due diligence process can be daunting! In America, the public schools have taught Americans, go to school, get a job, save money in a 401k, live within their means, finance a house, and pay taxes. And what exactly does that model produce? Anyone who has followed that model or knows someone who has certainly knows it most assuredly leads to more debt, on account of the financial banking system that has been in place in the United States ever since the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. That system is known as a central banking operation that functions from a fractional reserve system, which does nothing for the economy but increases the national debt and inflates the U.S. dollar, raising the cost of everyday goods and services.

## Page 5 – The Retirement Trap and Tax Brackets

What happens when a college degree allows a salary cap that finally reaches a threshold and cannot sustain everyday expenses due to inflation? The answer is more debt and more time needed to continue education seeking another degree to earn an additional annual $20k to $35k. Suppose an employee continues school and completes the extra training and successfully obtains that salary increase and reaches retirement, living off a fixed income. The cost of everyday goods and services continues to rise, surpassing that fixed income. What happens when the retiree's property tax becomes too expensive because of the surrounding neighborhood's increase in property value due to gentrification? What other options are there at the age of retirement? As scary as it sounds, the reality is that the elderly community is working past the age of 65 at local retail stores and offices. It would easily make sense to increase current wage earnings and reduce the current tax bracket to as low as Zero Percent to encourage significant savings for other entrepreneurial endeavors. What if Federal, State, Social Security, and Medicare taxes were not withheld from employee earnings and did not have to be paid during tax season? What if that were the case for self-employment 1099 information filings as well? How much of that could be saved in the right asset-building account for the future?

## Page 6 – Tax Brackets and the Voluntary Nature of Taxation

There are precisely seven tax brackets for most ordinary incomes in the United States; 10 percent tax, 12 percent tax, 22 percent tax, 24 percent tax, 32 percent tax, 35 percent tax, and 37 percent tax, and believe it or not, tax is voluntary. Many people here in the United States live beyond the American Dream, whether they are United States citizens, United States nationals, or Nationals.

Many of them understand life is not a journey but instead a process. The life of a journey goes up and down, not knowing when or where the goal is nigh. A process is tested time and time again with successful results, no matter the environment, and has a foreseeable end before it begins. The wealthy understand the necessary process of obtaining generational wealth from a simple truth, which is understanding how the United States truthfully came into existence, how it operates commercially, and how it applies to its inhabitants.

## Page 7 – Constitutional Classes and Wealth Secrets

The United States Constitution speaks of three different classes of people. The people, the subjects, and the citizens! What type are the majority today, and is one better than the other? It is a fact that there are approximately 11 million millionaires since 2017 and 788 billionaires in the United States since 2019, and most of them do not pay any taxes despite the famous saying, "The more you make, the more they take." Believe it or not, it has nothing to do with illegal tax evasion or hiding money in shell companies in tax haven countries. What exactly do the millionaires and billionaires know, and why does it seem like the educated alumni are the first to complete an unemployment application during a government financial crisis? How are the wealthy fairly procuring extreme amounts of money? Don't the tax bracket rules eat up most of their profits? How do they maintain good credit for 100% loan approvals several times a year? Does it take years to save substantial amounts of money to start a tax-exempt business? The answers to these meaningful questions have always been at the forefront, but knowing where to look and applying the information is another thing. Each chapter in The Zero Percent will provide the hidden answers many financial titans keep within their fold.

## Page 8 – Book Overview and Treaty Law

To resolve most Americans' financial issues, one must evaluate the various strategies of real estate investing and banking, credit secrets based on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), entering a new commercial status, all while comprehending the truth about the United States and its affiliates. All resources are provided for anyone to easily obtain certified copies of the undeniable evidence before the reconstruction of the united States of America (republic government). It's imperative to explain the step-by-step process to start any business the right way and obtaining federal and state recognition in their system to never be required to file not one tax return statement from day one! Instead, if it is the company owner's choice, a well-executed filing would provide a refund in the exact amount earned in the fiscal tax year. This is just one of the many trade-secrets kept by the one-percenters that operate under treaty law with the United States derived from God's ordinances. The Internal Revenue Service and the United States Treasury Department are in sync with Biblical Treaty Law. The commencement of business in the united States of America or anywhere in the world requires an understanding of biblical trade secrets regarding trust, which affects commerce; practiced by the wealthiest nations on earth, such as the Jews, Mennonites, Chinese, Saudi Arabians, Armenians, etc. Although the steps and procedures are subject to change over time, learning the commerce rules will lead to many untold truths about one's nationality and its importance to encourage all aspects of stronger and wiser families. Be prepared for the in depth legal jargon and it is recommended to repeatedly read the information until fully comprehended.

# Chapter One – The United States Corporation

## Page 1 – The United States as a Federal Corporation

The United States is a what? It's widespread that the United States is short for saying the United States of America, but how exactly can an entire country be on the same playing field as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft corporations? It is accurate, and Congress does not hide the truth in their codes and statutes. It may sound awkward to the majority because the elected officials never refer to the country as a company. In Title 28 U.S. Code § 3002 section 15, "United States" means – (A) a Federal corporation. The United States Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, file number 100009, was filed with the Secretary of State of New York, July 15, 1925, with its principal office in the Centennial Building, Tallahassee, Leon County. Section three and four states,

The maximum number of shares, which this corporation is authorized to have outstanding at any time is ONE HUNDRED (100), each of which shares shall have a par value of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). (Section Three)

The amount of capital with which the corporation will begin business is FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). (Section Four)

A certified copy of this imperative historical document can be obtained in Florida, revealing that the corporation is perpetual, meaning everlasting. The certificate provides its directors as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary of the United States Corporation. These individuals are the private officers; the public officers known as Donald Trump and Mike Pence or Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

## Page 2 – The Origins Before the Constitution

However, this document is indeed not the origin of the United States of America. In March of 1861, Abraham Lincoln gave his first inaugural speech. Surprisingly, the address translated to the English language from the Arabic language and many other treaties the United States has with the Aboriginal and Indigenous people. They were here in North, South, and Central America, long before Columbus. A straightforward search within the Library of Congress to find his speech titled Abraham Lincoln First Inaugural Address (1861), which the first paragraph cites,

In compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the President before he enters on the execution of this office. I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement. Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republic Administration, their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the amplest evidence, to the contrary, has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that—I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. (Abraham Lincoln First Inaugural Address, 1861)

## Page 3 – Translation Issues and Lincoln's Speech Analysis

Some keynotes to address regarding the President's speech. First, they are high tensions coming from the southern states regarding their property (i.e., their slaves) and President Lincoln's policy regarding the subject matter. He states that he has no plans to interfere with the slave trade in those particular states. Anyone who has studied history on a general level understands that Lincoln is known as the Great Emancipator, who freed the "black" slaves from involuntary servitude in 1865. Yet, he states he does not want to get involved with the institution of slavery.

Secondly, the proof of a mistranslation from the Arabic language to the English language when Lincoln states, "It is found in nearly all the published speeches of "him" who now addresses you." If Lincoln is the one giving the speech, he would not address himself as "Him" in the third person but instead in the first person, such as, "It is found in nearly all the published speeches that I have addressed you." One could think, how can such a mistake happen within an undisputable lawful congressional record? A more accurate question would be, why is President Lincoln speaking in Arabic in his inaugural speech in North America in 1861? Surprisingly, Latin was the common language in the entire world. There are words in one language that do not exist in another language to describe it adequately. The congressional record continues to reveal that President Lincoln explains how the corporation became to be and quote,

Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association, in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to "form a more perfect Union." (Abraham Lincoln First Inaugural Address, 1861)

## Page 4 – Articles of Association and Corporate Origins

According to President Lincoln, the United States Corporation found its existence from the Articles of Association in 1774. So what exactly are articles of association? The Articles is a document that specifies the regulations for a company's operation and defines its purpose. A company's articles of incorporation detail what the organization can and cannot do. Including appointing directors and handling financial records. Very similar to a select group of individuals who decide to start a corporation or LLC, and its articles of incorporation or organization must be approved by the state's Secretary of State because the corporation or LLC is seeking existence from the state in which it will transact business. The most obvious question is, if the individuals who seek to start a company must first obtain approval from the Secretary of State, then who approved the United States Corporation's articles? What authority permitted the U.S. corporation to exist? After all, Abraham Lincoln did say that the Constitution did not come about until 1787. To answer this question, examining the Articles of Association, 1774 itself, should provide great insight. It reads,

That from and after the first day of December next, we will not import, into British America, from Great-Britain or Ireland, any goods, wares, or merchandise whatsoever, or from any other place, any such goods, wares, or merchandise, as shall have been exported from Great-Britain or Ireland; nor will we, after that day, import any East-India tea from any part of the world; nor any molasses, syrups, paneles, coffee, or pimento, from the British plantations or from Dominica; nor wines from Madeira, or the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo. (Article One)

We will neither import nor purchase, any slave imported after the first day of December next; after which time, we will wholly discontinue the slave trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it. (Article Two)

## Page 5 – Commerce Under British America and Slavery

The first article tells us that commerce took place under British America, and various merchandise would cease importation from Great Britain to East-India. A more important fact is found in the second article, that no slave of any kind, meaning voluntary or involuntary servitude, would be allowed due to the slave trade being discontinued. How is it that slavery was allowed within the Southern States as Lincoln addressed and then abolished in North America in 1865 if slavery was never intended to occur as per the initial document that created the United States in 1774? Another fair question is, who exactly were the slaves involved in the slave trade during that time? A lot of attention and condemnation is directed towards the African slave trade tragedy. The 16th and 19th century is when this took place. However, another equally despicable trading of humans was taking place around the same time in the Mediterranean's proximity. The Barbary pirates enslaved approximately 1.25 million Europeans, and their lives were just as pitiful as the Africans. They were referred to as the white slaves of the Barbary Slave Trade. Slavery is one of the oldest transactions known to man, and the records of the slave trade date back to The Code of Hammurabi in Babylon in the 18th century, are available.

## Page 6 – The Barbary Slave Trade

People from virtually every significant culture, civilization, and religious background have made slaves of their own and enslaved other peoples. However, comparatively little attention is focused on the prolific slave trade carried out by the pirates of corsairs along the Barbary coast (as the Europeans called it in that period) in what is now the empire of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya beginning around 1600 AD. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Christian pirates were primarily from Catalonia and Sicily, which conquered all admiralty seas, posing a constant threat to merchants. It was not until the Ottoman Empire's expansion in the 15th century that the Barbary corsairs started to become an irritable problem to Christian vessels. While the Barbary slave trade is depicted as Muslim corsairs capturing white Christian victims, the pirates were not concerned with the ethnicity or religious orientation of those held in captivity. Slaves in Barbary could be of any color with multiple backgrounds: black, brown or white, Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish, or Muslim. It was all about their class of commercial status, which dictated slavery or not. The pirates were not only Muslim; however, English privateers and Dutch captains of the Dutch India Trading Company also exploited the ever-changing loyalties of how neighboring friends could quickly become enemies and enemies' could become colleagues with the stroke of a pen as per private contracts.

## Page 7 – Conditions of Barbary Slaves

The captive slaves by the Barbary pirates faced a dark and horrible future. Many perished on the ships during the long voyage back to North Africa (North America, at this time) due to disease or lack of sustenance and hydration. Those who survived were taken to slave markets where they would stand for hours while buyers inspected them before selling at public or private auctions. Once slaves were purchased, they were immediately forced to work in several ways. Men were assigned to hard manual labor using their strength, such as working the quarries or heavy strenuous construction, while women and children were used for housework or sexual servitude. At night, the slaves were placed into prisons called bagnios that were uncomfortably hot and overcrowded. However, the worst fate for a Barbary slave could endure working the oars of galleys. Rowers were shackled together, seated, and never allowed to stand or leave their post. No form of privacy was allowed in the oars, only sleeping, eating, defecation, and urination at the oars' seat. Managing overseers would crack the whip over the bare backs of any slaves considered not to be working hard enough.

## Page 8 – Dutch West India Company and the Term "Indian"

As previously stated, Dutch captains were working alongside the Barbary pirates, who were associated with a significant Atlantic Slave Trade company named the Dutch West India Company, whose native name is Geoctrooieerde Westindische Compagnie. It was a Chartered West India Company founded on June 3, 1621, by Willem Usselincx and Jesse de Forest and other Dutch merchants and foreign investors. The company was permitted a charter for a trade monopoly founded within the Dutch West Indies. It is known that the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands granted this permission under the empire of Morocco and gave jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the Atlantic Slave Trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. Looking back at Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean's film franchise, British America always displayed their Dutch West or East India Company flag while at sail, fighting against the pirates (i.e., Barbary pirates). All slaves within the company were classified as the Dutch West India Company employees and took on the identity, Indian! This is where the term Indian originates. The trading company could operate in West Africa and the Americas, which further included what is known today as the United States' outlying possessions.

## Page 9 – Multiple Origins of Slaves and the Moors

There were slaves of all skin tones coming to the Americas, not just from Africa, contrary to popular belief, as told in public school textbooks. To refer back to the original question, who played the Secretary of State's role authorizing the Articles of Association of 1774 permitting the British America Corporation to transact agricultural and merchandise business on North American lands? The great Moor, the Sultan, in connection with his Majesty's King George, governed many dominions and permitted the Anglo-Saxon traders from Great Britain to begin their agricultural conquest on the east of North America (ancient Egypt – Mehomitan Nation), which developed into the Thirteen Colonies, which led to the development of the Department of Agriculture in 1862. The Atlantic Slave Trade aligned with the Dutch West India Trading Company, on the colonies' territories, found its way into the Southern States of America. Now, what exactly is a Moor? A Moor is currently known today as a Black or African American, with a complexion formerly known as swarthy (dark olive-skinned) or tawny (yellowish, red, golden-skinned). The term Moor is throughout the I599 Geneva Bible, describing everyone to be swarthy and tawney complexion. The newer translated bibles purposely replace the Moors with Phoenicians, Ethiopians, Greeks, or Hebrews. Intermarrying took place between the Moors and the less-melanated slaves, referred to as quadroons, a person who is one-quarter Moor ancestry, and octoroons, a person who is one-eighth Moor ancestry, or hexadecaroons, which is a person who has one-sixteenth Moor ancestry. Intermarrying led to mulatto's (a person mixed white and Moor ancestry, especially a person with one white and one Moor parent).

## Page 10 – The Sultan's Authorization and King George III

The Sultan, also referred to as the Imperial Majesty, permitted the Articles of Association of 1774 for the British America Corporation. That very document stated that no slavery of any kind would take place within North America. The Anglo-Saxons of Great Britain were under slavery themselves, controlled by the British Moors (i.e., Brutish Moors), including the European Slavic's (slaves), and others were being mistreated and brought to North America; all while under the reign of King George III (a Moor). The European Slavic's, the Africans, the Octoroons, etc., and other highly "melanated" people were branded Negro, Colored, Indian, Black remained as slaves except for the Anglo-Saxon peoples. The others were considered a rebel group and promoted insurrection against the Brutish Moors. King George III was a Moor, who possessed plenipotentiary action, ruled Britain as a Dominion of Morocco (Mehomitan Nation) under the Sultan, and authorized the Declaration of Independence of 1776, freeing the Anglo-Saxons from the Brutish Moors, to inhabit the available territories of incorporated British America within the colonies.

## Page 11 – Post-Independence Slavery and Debtor Prisons

Although the Declaration of Independence of 1776 freed the slaves, slavery was still oppressive throughout the thirteen colonial territories. It was repackaged and sold in a new form known as debtor camps of debtor prisons. Before diving into the debtor camps, Abraham Lincoln stated it was the Articles of Confederation of 1778 to follow the Declaration of Independence. The former British America Corporation would later be known as the United States of America in Congress Assembled. The Articles of Confederation kindly addresses all in the onset,

"To all to whom these presents shall come, We, the undersigned, Delegates of the States affixed to our Names, send greeting: Whereas the Delegates of the United States of America in Congress assembled, did on November 15, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, and in the second year of the Independence of America, agree to certain Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia."

In 1787, the United States of America's Constitution was finalized to make a perfect union between all the states during a constitutional convention. It was all a republic in an attempt to bring together the Powhatan Confederacy and Iroquois Confederacy.

## Page 12 – George Washington's Letter to Emperor Sidi Mohammed

In New York on December 1, 1789, George Washington of the Washitaw Tribe wrote a letter to his masonic brother, Emperor Sidi Mohammed. The letter is fascinating due to the unknown truth that the two confederacies (Powhatan and Iroquois) were at war with each other regarding matters of the right to leave the property in trust to their heirs who were Mulattos from the intermarrying with Indian women of the Dutch slave trade. It was against the Mehomidan Law to turn over the property from a creditor or one who held Title of Nobility over to one who had a debtor's status, which was not of full blood descent. Title of Nobility was the real issue that motivated the Civil War between the confederacies and the apprehension within the Southern States that Lincoln was referring to in his inaugural speech of 1861!

The letter from Washington to the Emperor can be found within the Library of Congress or on founders.archives.gov/documents. It reads,

To Sidi Mohammed, Since the Date of the Letter, which the "late Congress," by "their President" (meaning previous republican Moor President), addressed to your Imperial Majesty, the United States of America have thought proper to "change their Government," (meaning the Moors of the Continental Congress Assembled) and to "institute a new one" (meaning from republic to democratic) agreeable to the Constitution, of which I have the Honor of, herewith, enclosing a Copy. The Time necessarily employed in this arduous Task, and the Derangements occasioned by so great, though "peaceable a Revolution" (meaning to peacefully change the political system of one's country), will apologize, and account for your Majesty's not having received those regular "Advices, and Marks of Attention" (meaning blackmail or tax payment for protected services), from the United States, which the Friendship and "Magnanimity" (meaning generous in forgiving an insult) of your Conduct, towards them, afforded reason to expect.

## Page 13 – Washington's Letter Continued

The "United States" (meaning corporation), having unanimously appointed me to the supreme "executive" (meaning having the power to put plans, actions, or laws into effect) authority, in this nation, your Majesty's Letter of the August 17, 1788, which, by Reason of the "Dissolution" (meaning the closing down or dismissal of a republic) of the late government, remained unanswered, has been delivered to me. I have also received the Letters which your Imperial Majesty has been so kind as to write, in Favor of the United States, to the Bashaws of Tunis and Tripoli, and I present to you the sincere acknowledgments, and Thanks of the United States, for this important Mark of your Friendship for them. We greatly regret that the hostile Disposition of those Regencies, towards this nation, who have never injured them, is not to be removed, on Terms in our power to comply with. Within our "Territories" (meaning thirteen colonies) there are no Mines, either of Gold, or Silver, and this young nation, just recovering from the "Waste and Desolation of a long War" (meaning the Civil War including the wars between Tunis, Tripoli, Iroquois and Powhatan), have not, as yet, had time to acquire Riches by Agriculture and Commerce. But our Soil is bountiful, and our People industrious; and we have reason to flatter ourselves, that we shall gradually become useful to our Friends.

## Page 14 – Washington's Gratitude and Future Commitments

The Encouragement which your Majesty has been pleased, generously, to give to our commerce with your "Dominions" (meaning territory of the Mehomitan Nation) the Punctuality with which you have caused the treaty with us to be observed, and the just and generous Measures taken, in the Case of Captain Proctor, made a deep Impression on the United States, and confirm their Respect for, and Attachment to your Imperial Majesty. It gives me Pleasure to have this Opportunity of assuring your Majesty that, while I remain at the "Head of this Nation" (meaning United States Corporation), I shall not cease to promote every Measure that may conduce to the Friendship and Harmony, which so happily subsist between your Empire and them, and shall esteem myself happy in every Occasion of convincing your Majesty of the high Sense (which in common with the whole nation) I entertain of the Magnanimity, Wisdom, and "Benevolence" (meaning the quality of kindness) of your Majesty. In the Course of the approaching Winter, the national Legislature (which is called by the former Name of Congress) will assemble, and I shall take Care that Nothing be omitted that may be necessary to cause the Correspondence, between our Countries, to be maintained and conducted in a Manner agreeable to your Majesty, and satisfactory to all the Parties concerned in it. May the Almighty bless your Imperial Majesty, our great and magnanimous Friend, with his constant Guidance and Protection. Written at the City of New York the first Day of December 1789. – Addressed to our great and magnanimous Friend, His imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Morocco. (From George Washington To Sidi Mohammed, December 1, 1789 – founders.archives.gov)

## Page 15 – Debtor Prisons and Loss of Title of Nobility

Regarding the penal colonies, as mentioned, the former Moors, now known as the Negro, the Black, the Colored, the Octoroon, and even the Indian employee of the Dutch slave trade, would eventually accumulate great amounts of debt from the loss of Title of Nobility. Working in the thirteen colonies, debts were paid to the Department of Agriculture collections department, in contract with the Dutch East/West India Trading Company. The inhabitants of the debtor prisons were to work off their debt. As the Mehomidan Law was ignored by the Moors, intermingling their seed with foreigners and seeking to pass their inheritance to their offspring, the various wars continued, leaving the Sultan with no choice but to strip their title of nobility away to preserve the lands and the law. New trustees would emerge and control their inheritance in trust, placing the Moors' remnants to become indebted and to endure the Trials of Job. In the Bible and the Quran, Job experienced loss and hardship that no man has ever experienced.

## Page 16 – British Use of Colonial North America as Penal Colony

The British (Anglo-Saxons, New Trustees) used colonial North America as a penal colony through indentured servitude. Merchants transported convicts and Indians, auctioned to plantation trustees upon arrival to the colonies. An estimated 50,000 British convicts (Indian employees) were delivered to colonial North America. Transported convicts represented perhaps a quarter of all British emigrants during the 18th century. For example, the colony of Georgia was founded by James Edward Oglethorpe, who originally intended to use prisoners taken largely from debtor prisons, creating a "Debtor Colony," where the prisoners could learn trades and work off their debts. Every photograph or paintings of a black slave adult or child working on the plantations was attributed to this purpose, a debtor prison or colony for nothing more than working off debts, not slaves brought to America from Africa alone. General James Edward Oglethorpe founded the Georgia Corporation, known today as the State of Georgia. The General, including other trustees such as Thomas Marriott (a forefather of JW Marriott) of the Colony of Georgia, agreed with the Creek Nation to become the land's trustees to collect debts owed to His Majesty, King George.

## Page 17 – The Treaty of Savannah and Creek Nation Lands

The Creek Nation lands had become populated with Dutch India Trading Company employees (Indians) that assumed the land from the native Moors due to intermarrying and death from the many wars. The collection of debts to the Colony of Georgia was collected from the Indians, also known as Five Dollar Indians, to surrender their rebellion and insurrection against Great Britain. The trustee(s) of the Colony of Georgia would become the equitable owners in exchange for $300,000 as consideration, leaving the Creek Nation as "tenants in commons." The evidence of this trade can be reviewed within the Treaty of Savannah of 1733 and The Georgia Historical Quarterly, March 1920, Vol. 4, No. 1, pages 3-16, which reads,

To All to Whom these Presents shall come: I Stephen Theodore Janssen Lord Mayor of the City of London In pursuance of an act of Parliament made and passed in the fifth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King George the Second Entitled an Act for the more easy recovery of Debts in His Majesty's Plantations and Colonies in America, (Page 4 - The Georgia Historical Quarterly, March 1920, Vol. 4, No. 1)

And they do acknowledge the Grant they have already made to the Trustees for Establishing the Colony of Georgia in America all the Lands upon Savannah River as far as the Ogeechee and all the Lands along the Sea-Coast as far as the River St. John's and as high as the tyde flows and all the Islands as far as the said River Particularly the Islands of Frederica, Cumberland and Amelia to which they have given the names of his Majesty King George's Family out of gratitude to him. But they Declare that they did and do reserve to the Creek Nation the Lands from Pipe Maker's Bluff to Savannah and the Islands of Saint Catherines, Ossebaw, and Sapelo; and they further declare that all the said Lands are held by the Creek Nation as Tenants in Common – (Page 7 - The Georgia Historical Quarterly, March 1920, Vol. 4, No. 1)

## Page 18 – The Charter of Georgia 1732

The Charter of Georgia of 1732 can be examined from the Lillian Goldman Law Library, The Avalon Project that reads,

And whereas we have been well assured, that if we will be most graciously pleased to erect and settle a corporation, for the receiving, managing and disposing of the contributions of our loving subjects; divers persons would be induced to contribute to the uses and purposes aforesaid-Know ye, therefore, that we have, for the considerations aforesaid, and for the better and more orderly carrying on the said good purposes; of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, willed, ordained, constituted and appointed, and by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, do will, ordain, constitute, declare and grant, that our right trusty and well-beloved John, lord-viscount Percival, of our kingdom of Ireland, our trusty and well-beloved Edward Digby, George Carpenter, James Oglethorpe, George Heathcote, Thomas Tower, Robert Moore, Robert Hucks, Roger Holland, William Sloper, Francis Eyles, John Laroche, James Vernon, William Beletha, esquires, A. M. John Burton, B. D. Richard Bundy, A. M. Arthur Bedford, A. M. Samuel Smith, A. M. Adam Anderson and Thomas Corane, gentlemen; and such other persons as shall be elected in the manner hereinafter mentioned, and their successors to be elected in the manner hereinafter directed; be, and shall be one body politic and corporate, in deed and in name, by the name of the Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America. And we do hereby, for our heirs and successors, ordain, will and establish, that for and during the term of twenty-one years, to commence from the date of these our letters patent, the said corporation assembled for that purpose, shall and may form and prepare, laws, statutes, and ordinances, fit and necessary for and concerning the government of the said colony, and not repugnant to the laws and statutes of England.

## Page 19 – Georgia as Corporation and Treaty With the Delawares

The State of Georgia is a corporation like every other "State Of," within the United States of America Corporation. Its trustees listed above were the Anglo-Saxon peoples from Britain who were once property to the British (Brutish) Moors. Shortly after the Declaration of Independence, in 1776 and within the same year as the Articles of Confederation, in 1778, the thirteen colonies' trustees formed the United States. Of the thirteen colonies were the Delawares who are also recognized as the Delaware Nation and they instituted the six article Treaty With the Delawares, 1778. The Delaware Nation were Moors and were nationals. They are not to be mistaken as Indians. The treaty states,

Articles of agreement and confederation, made and, entered; into by, Andrew and Thomas Lewis, Esquires, Commissioners for, and in Behalf of the United States of North-America of the one Part, and Capt. White Eyes, Capt. John Kill Buck, Junior, and Capt. Pipe, Deputies and Chief Men of the Delaware Nation of the other Part.

Article V. Whereas the confederation entered into by the Delaware nation and the United States, renders the first dependent on the latter for all the articles of clothing, utensils and implements of war, and it is judged not only reasonable, but indispensably necessary, that the aforesaid Nation be supplied with such articles from time to time, as fas as the United States may have it in their power, by a well-regulated trade, under the conduct of an intelligent, candid agent, with an adequate salary, one more influenced by the love of his country, and a constant attention to the duties of his department by promoting the common interest, than the sinister purposes of converting and binding all the duties of his office to his private emolument: Convinced of the necessity of such measures, the Commissioners of the United States, at the earnest solicitation of the deputies aforesaid, have engaged in behalf of the United States, that such a trade shall be afforded said nation conducted on such principles of mutual interest as the wisdom of the United States in Congress assembled shall think most conducive to adopt for their mutual convenience.

## Page 20 – Delaware Treaty Article VI and Representation

Article VI. Whereas the enemies of the United States have endeavoured, by every artifice in their power, to possess the Indians in general with an opinion, that it is the design of the States aforesaid, to extirpate the Indians and take possession of their country to obviate such false suggestion, the United States do engage to guarantee to the aforesaid nation of Delawares, and their heirs, all their territorial rights in fullest and most ample manner, as it hath been bounded by former treaties, as long as the said Delaware nation shall abide by, and hold fast the chain of friendship now entered into. And it is further agreed on between the contracting parties should it for the future be found conducive for the mutual interest of both parties to invite any other tribes who have been friends to the interest of the United States, to join the present confederation, and to form a state whereof the Delaware nation shall be the head, and have a representation in Congress: Provided, nothing contained in this article to be considered as conclusive until it meets with the approbation of Congress. And it is also the intent and meaning of this article, that no protection or countenance shall be afforded to any who are at present our enemies, by which they might escape the punishment they deserve.

## Page 21 – Delaware Nation as First State and Real Enemies

The fifth article describes why the State of Delaware is known as the First State. The Delaware Nation provided an internal agreement to enter into trade markets with the United States. The sixth article provides that the United States had real enemies known as the southern States who wanted to eradicate or re-enslave all of the Indians from the slave trade with permission from the Moors of the Delaware Nation, including any other nations who agreed to aid the United States. This treaty confirms that the Moors of the Delaware Nation, including other nations, are truly aboriginal to North America and are completely separate from the misnomer term Indian.

One of the most popular among the Anglo-Saxons was Benjamin (Ben' Yamin) Franklin, and he expressed who were present in not just the Americas but also the entire face of the earth. Franklin wrote many essays. One of his most important writings was sent to Peter Collinson and Richard Jackson, which appeared in the Gentlemen's Magazine for November 1755 and the Scots Magazine for April 1756. In 1760 and 1761, it was printed, with excisions, as an appendix to London, Dublin, Boston, and Philadelphia editions of Franklin's Interest of Great Britain Considered. It was reprinted in part in the London Chronicle, May 20, 1760. Franklin included it in the fourth edition of his Experiments and Observations of Electricity, 1769. His essay can also be found within the founders.archives.gov website; section twenty-three and twenty-four of the essay reads,

## Page 22 – Benjamin Franklin on Complexion and Population

And since Detachments of English from Britain sent to America, will have their Places at Home so soon supply'd and increase so largely here; why should the "Palatine" (the meaning of an official or feudal lord having local authority that elsewhere belongs only to a sovereign) "Boors" (meaning ill-mannered persons) be suffered to swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion, which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely "white" (Anglo-Saxon) people in the world is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or "tawny" (yellowish, red, golden light-skinned). Asia is chiefly tawny! America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so! And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians, and Swedes, are generally of what we call a "swarthy" (dark olive-skinned) Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? Why Increase the Sons of Africa by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind. (Observations Concerning The Increase of Mankind, 1751 – founders.archives.gov)

## Page 23 – Complexion Demographics and Treaty With Morocco

The main thing to take away from Mr. Franklin's words is that 269 years ago, people known today as "Blacks" or "African-Americans" were everywhere on the earth and people known as "Whites" are properly known as the Anglo-Saxons, are fairly new to inhabiting the earth. A large number of people referred to as either swarthy or tawny outnumbered them. Once the republican government of the United States of America Corporation was formed in 1787, its Constitution reformed to a democratic in 1789, as George Washington mentioned in his letter to the Emperor. It was necessary for the Moors within the First Continental Congress to establish a treaty for commerce with Morocco's other dominions (Mehomitan Nation). The Treaty – Between the United States of America, and His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Morocco of January 1787, can be obtained through the Library of Congress. The Twenty-Six article treaty begins with a preface addressing its Ministers and Moroccan Ambassadors for his Majesty, the Emperor. Towards the end of the preface, before the seal of his Majesty, it reads,

hath arranged articles for a treaty of amity and commerce between the United States of America, and his Majesty the Emperor of Morocco, which articles, written in the Arabic language, confirmed by his said Majesty the Emperor of Morocco, and sealed with his royal seal, being translated into the language of the said United States of America, together with the attestations thereto annexed, are in the following words, to wit:

In the Name of Almighty God. This is a Treaty of Peace and Friendship established between us and the United States of America, which is confirmed, and which we have ordered to be written in this book, and sealed with our royal seal, at our court of Morocco, on the twenty-fifth day of the blessed month of Shaban, in the year one thousand two hundred, trusting in God it will remain permanent. (Treaty of Peace and Friendship – Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America. Edited by Hunter Miller, Volume 2, Documents 1-40: 1776-1818, Washington: Government Printing Office, 1931.)

## Page 24 – Public Law 857 and U.S. Consuls in Morocco

Other evidence of the U.S. residing in Morocco (Mehomitan Nation) can be found in Public Law 857 – August 1, 1956, which reads,

Whereas the consuls of the United States in Morocco are permitted to exercise jurisdiction over American nationals under the treaty between the United States, and Morocco signed September 16, 1836, and the Act of Algeciras signed April 7, 1906. (Public Law 857 – August 1, 1956, 70 STAT, page 774)

To further clarify P.L. 857, the consuls of the U.S. are located in North America (Morocco – Mehomitan Nation), and the U.S. is permitted jurisdiction over U.S. nationals, also known as U.S. citizens by the treaty of September 16, 1836; which is the Morocco – Treaty of Peace. Permission over American citizens can be found in articles twenty through twenty-three.

If any of the citizens of the United States, or any persons under their protection, shall have any disputes with each other, the Consul shall decide between the parties, and whenever the Consul shall require any aid or assistance from our government to enforce his decisions, it shall be immediately granted to him. (Morocco – Treaty of Peace: Article twenty)

If a citizen of the United States should kill or wound a Moor, or on the contrary, if a Moor shall kill or wound a citizen of the United States, the law of the country shall take place, and equal justice shall be rendered, the Consul assisting at the trial; and if any delinquent makes his escape, the Consul shall not be answerable for him in any manner whatever. (Morocco – Treaty of Peace: Article twenty-one)

## Page 25 – Morocco Treaty Articles Twenty-Two and Twenty-Three

If an American citizen shall die in our country, and no will shall appear, the Consul shall take possession of his effects; and if there shall be no consul, the effects shall be deposited in the hands of some person worthy of trust, until the party shall appear who has a right to demand them; but if the heir to the person deceased be present, the property shall be delivered to him without interruption; and if a will appears, the property shall descend agreeable to that will as soon as the Consul shall declare the validity thereof. (Morocco – Treaty of Peace: Article twenty-two)

The consuls of the United States of America shall reside in any seaport of our dominion that they shall think proper, and they shall be respected, and enjoy all the privileges which the consuls of any other nation enjoy; and if any of the citizens of the United States shall contract any debts or engagements, the Consul shall not be in any manner accountable for them, unless he shall have given a promise in writing for the payment or fulfilling thereof, without which promise in writing, no application to him for any redress shall be made. (Morocco – Treaty of Peace: Article twenty-three - Treaties of Other International Acts of the United States of America, Edited by Hunter Miller, Volume 4, Documents 1-40: 1776-1818.)

## Page 26 – The Organic Act of 1871 and District of Columbia

The democracy was further matured by establishing a separate city-state, a body corporate for the District of Columbia, formed on February 21, 1871. The 41st Congress, Session III, Chapter 61, 62, page 419, declares An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia, known as the Organic Act of 1871. It reads,

CHAP. LXII – An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all that part of the territory of the United States included within the limits of the District of Columbia be, and the same is hereby, created into a government by the name of the District of Columbia, by which name it is hereby constituted a body corporate for municipal purposes, and may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, have a seal, and exercise all other powers of a municipal corporation not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and the provisions of this act. (Organic Act of 1871 – Section one, page 419)

## Page 27 – The Empire of the City and Fourteenth Amendment

The Organic Act of 1871 is an Act of Congress that repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown and established a new territorial government for the whole of D.C. The District of Columbia (controlling the world militarily) joined the other two city-states, Vatican City (controlling the world's religion) and London City (controlling the world's financial/law sector), to make up the three corporations, The Empire of the City, that runs the world. Due to the fourteenth amendment, many people, including the Moors who once had Title of Nobility and were creditors on their land (the Americas), lost their lawful status and nationality and became subject to the District of Columbia by way of the Sultan allying with the democratic United States. This truth can be found in the Library of Congress, titled Citizenship of the United States, Expatriation, etc.,

There are, strictly speaking, no Moroccan laws relating to citizenship of Moorish subjects in Morocco. The fundamental laws of this non-Christian country are based entirely upon the Islamitic code, no part of which treats the subject of citizenship. There are, however, numerous treaties and conventions between the various Christian countries and the Moorish Empire, by means of which citizenship in this country is defined; but, as I understand, from the above-acknowledged instructions, that it is not the desire of the Department to call for a report upon such lines, I will, therefore, confine these remarks to general conditions existing, which may possibly be of some use in connection with the information desired.

## Page 28 – Moroccan Citizenship and Loss of Nationality

(1) Citizenship in Morocco may be said to be governed by the laws pertaining to the same in other countries, with the exception that all persons residing in Morocco who cannot prove foreign citizenship or protection are considered ipso jure as Moorish subjects. (2 and 3) Moorish subjects lost their nationality only by becoming naturalized in or protected by another country having treaty relations with the Moorish Empire. (Citizenship of the United States, Expatriation, etc., Pages 459-460)

The Moors lost their nationality after the Civil War by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and other nationalities. Due to the several treaties connected with the U.S. and through naturalization and protection from the U.S., nationality is forfeited. The U.S. has maintained its position of power by utilizing deceiving contracts, in which U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and even foreign nationals unknowingly submit consent to several contracts. The deceptive contractual offers that promote protection and naturalization of the United States fall within the category of accepting benefits and privileges that the United States freely gives its citizens within the public sector. There is a difference between operating in public and in private.

## Page 29 – Benefits and Privileges: Social Security and Driver's Licenses

Such benefits and privileges of the United States consist of taking uncertificated securities, including everything related to the social security number, applications related to "driver's" licenses, and the so-called right to "vote." All of the above require the social security number to obtain a license or register to vote locally and nationally. The definition of a driver is,

One employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon, or other vehicles, with horses, mules, or other animals, or a bicycle, tricycle, or motor car, though not a street railroad car. (See Davis v. Petrinovich, 112 Ala. 654, 21 South. 344, 36 L.R. A.615; Gen. St. Conn, 1902)

And the definition of vote is,

Suffrage; the voice of an individual in making a choice by many. The vote of an elector. To vote, means to cast a vote; to deposit a ballot or register a choice in an election. (Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, page 1575)

## Page 30 – Voting as Representation and Public vs Private

Voters of the United States and its territories agree to select a representative from a political party to represent the elector's voice in municipal, state, and federal elections. To drive and to vote are both activities in the public sector. To operate in public is to automatically assign oneself as a surety for the United States Corporation, its municipalities, and its territories. However, one operates in the private sector if one is not engaged in the public employment of the United States and its affiliates. The public and private relationship is similar to a landlord and tenant relationship. Both have different statuses (creditor and debtor), although both reside on the same property.

The private is the landlord, also known as the creditor; they have superior unalienable rights and possess ownership to the land. The tenant is known as the debtor; they have inferior privileges and possess only equitable ownership to the land. The public is also the tenant and is the debtor who utilizes the benefits and privileges of the United States upon the landlord's land and subjects themselves to the statutes and codes. The private is the landlord and is the creditor who, by right, travels upon their land that is free from the United States Constitution, a law unto themselves.

## Page 31 – Fourteenth Amendment and Change of Status

The fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution that reads, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside," was to change the status of Moors and anyone else who possessed title of nobility, into debtors (tenants). The Moorish Creditors', who once owned the land and had unalienable rights, now became United States citizens (debtors) who accept the U.S. benefits and privileges to receive inferior civil rights. The title of nobility derived from God's law, also known as biblical or natural law, and the Superior Grand Law of this land is the Declaration of Independence of 1776, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8, of the Constitution of 1787, which states,

No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. (Constitution for the United States of America, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8)

In plain English, any national that enters into a public position by accepting money or other form of payment for services rendered on behalf of the United States agrees to forgo their nationality and titles from their native country. This includes social security insurance programs as well.

# Chapter Two – The 14th Amendment Citizen

## Page 1 – Birth Certificates and Legal Presumptions

Most people in the United States believe they are American by merely being born on American soil. All hospitals supply a medical birth record after a live birth or stillborn baby is delivered, which is not the same as a certified birth certificate issued by the county or city's vital records office. The medical birth record or Certificate of Live Birth is the foundation used to produce a certified copy of the birth certificate that includes the embossed state seal. The question is, what does a birth certificate prove? A birth certificate is not and has never been proof of nationality. Many foreign nationals and migrants are born every day in U.S. territories or the United States without any penalty; however, they are not United States citizens. The United States still recognizes them as foreign nationals because of another official document that the courts demand to see, which displays nationality. That document is known as a passport.

## Page 2 – Passports and Proof of Citizenship

A passport is an official government document that certifies one's identity and citizenship and permits a citizen to travel to and from foreign countries. There are only two types of United States passports. The first is a passport book with a dark blue cover, for U.S. citizens. The second is a passport book with a maroon cover, for non-citizen U.S. nationals. Why does the government provide two different types of passports to people born on U.S. soil? The answer is quite simple; not everyone born in the United States is automatically a United States citizen as the fourteenth amendment claim.

When a mother gives birth to a child in a hospital, a representative from the hospital provides the mother with a worksheet to complete the information needed to file for a birth certificate. Most people, who are the mother or father of the newborn child, do not realize that it is optional to obtain a birth certificate. The confusion comes from the propaganda the public is led to believe that the government requires a birth certificate. Suppose the mother and father do decide to file for the birth certificate. The question one might ask is, who is filing? Is it the mother and father, or is it the hospital filing on behalf of the mother and father?

## Page 3 – The Informant and Certificate Filing

The answer is the hospital, whose representative serves as the informant on the birth certificate filing. What exactly is an informant? According to Black's Law Dictionary, an informant is a person who informs against another; one who confidentially supplies information to the police relating to a violation of law, a planned crime, contraband, fugitives, or otherwise assists in preventing or detecting crime. The informant has no authority to sign as the mother or father but simply relays the information the parent provides to the hospital, which led the county or city clerk to believe that the mother and father intended to create a United States citizen, subject to U.S. jurisdiction.

A live birth creates a man or a woman. However, once the birth is registered by the informant with the county or city clerk, through the vital records office, this starts the process of creating a fiction known as a citizen of the United States. The Citizen of the United States is a corporate entity; it is not a man or woman. The birth registration process causes the government to establish a legal presumption that a citizenship trust has been created. The newborn man or woman becomes the grantor of that trust and simultaneously becomes the beneficiary of the trust. The corporate legal fiction (i.e., U.S. citizen) is the trustee, and the United States is the guardian and beneficiary.

## Page 4 – The Trust Structure and All Caps Name

Upon completion of the birth registration, the county or city clerk sends a copy to the Bureau of Vital Statistics, managed by the Centers for Disease Control. The Bureau forwards a copy to the Social Security Administration, who creates a social security bond or security (estate) in the newborn's name. The all caps name is the trustee's name. The child's name is in all capital letters on the social security card. Why is it in all capitalized letters? According to the Chicago Manual of Style, a well-known reference book for writers, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers, section 8.153 titled "All caps," states,

Words and phrases in all capital letters are used for emphasis (often in ironic or skeptical contexts) or in legal documents for defined terms. The choice of small caps and all caps should be guided by the usage in the field, or lacking clear direction, by the designer's or author's preference. {If the landlord ("Landlord") fails to make repairs, Tenant may...} (The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition, 8.153 "All Caps," page 483)

## Page 5 – Legal Fictions and the Deceased Trust

The all capital letters found on the birth certificate, social security card, credit cards, bank statements, mortgages, utility bills, and driver's licenses is not the man or woman's true name. Instead, it is a corporation, or legal fiction, or corporate vessel. The ALL CAPS name or Strawman is a dead entity, and the individual who uses the social security number attached to the ALL CAPS name believes they are the ALL CAPS name and subjects themselves to act as a surety for the United States. This is confirmed by the death presumption of the Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666, and the holder of the legal title is the United States.

The Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666 is a law that allowed the creation of a trust to manage the estate of individuals presumed lost at sea after seven years. The individual was declared legally deceased, although there was no physical proof of death. The executors or trustees could petition the court to manage or obtain someone's property. The court creates a "deceased estate" to keep the title to the land. The United States applies this same strategy. Once the birth certificate is created in ALL CAPS letters, the United States assumes that the man or woman is lost at sea and presumed dead. The United States becomes the administrator of the dead man or woman's estate.

## Page 6 – Accepting U.S. Citizenship Through Actions

However, the man or woman is obviously alive and well. Since the man or woman received the birth certificate in the mail, the natural human never rebutted the United States' claim that they are the legal fiction (ALL CAPS name) created from the birth certificate registration. The man or woman is not a United States citizen; however, actions speak louder than words. If the man or woman goes to a social security office or online to complete an application for the social security number or card by using information from a birth certificate as proof of United States citizenship and accepts the social security card, this is definite proof that the man or woman consented to be and act as a United States citizen. Accepting the card and pledging to accept the estate in the ALL CAPS name confirms the United States citizen status and the change of nationality.

Accepting the social security card is prima facie evidence of U.S. citizen status. Why? Because the man or woman went into the social security office without any obligation to apply for a social security number and obtained the social security number under the notion that applying was mandatory. The government does not require anyone to have a social security number. The Social Security Administration even warns against obtaining the number. Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), subpart E, part 422.103, states,

You should apply for a social security number if you want an account number assigned under the social security program. However, your decision about getting a number must be made on a voluntary and completely informed basis without any direct or implied duress. (20 CFR § 422.103)

## Page 7 – Voluntary Nature of Social Security

The social security number is considered an uncertificated security. An uncertificated security is a security held in a book-entry system, that is, recorded in the issuer's computer files rather than represented by a physical certificate. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, an uncertificated security is as legally valid as a security with a certificate. One does not need to have a social security number; however, the government offers many benefits and privileges with the number that is difficult to ignore, such as getting a driver's license, opening a bank account, obtaining a credit card, securing a home mortgage, and even enrolling children into a public school. All of the above must have the social security number as it is the perfect tracking device the government uses to keep a watchful eye over its citizens and to promote good credit scores. These benefits and privileges serve as the seduction to get the consent of the natural man or woman to represent the United States corporate citizen entity (a.k.a., the legal fiction in all caps letters).

Even though most people believe that their social security number is private, and no other entity can demand the social security number without permission, the fact is, the number never belonged to the man or woman. The social security number is issued to an estate, which is government property. The social security number is property of the United States, and the United States can do as it pleases with it and disclose the number to anyone. The IRS receives access to social security numbers from the Social Security Administration; they can contact third parties such as employers to disclose social security numbers for their employees without their knowledge.

## Page 8 – Privacy Act and Social Security Disclosure

The Privacy Act of 1974 was created to give some protection to the individual. The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) protects personal information held by the federal government by preventing unauthorized disclosures of such information. Individuals also have the right to review personal information held by federal agencies. Section (e) (3) reads,

Each agency that maintains a system of records shall – inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on the form which it uses to collect the information or on a separate form that can be retained by the individual, of the authority (whether granted by statute, or by executive order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary. (Privacy Act of 1974; 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e)(3))

The federal government is required to inform every individual that disclosing the social security number to any governmental or non-governmental entity is voluntary. If an entity asks for the social security number, the requesting entity must give notice in writing, declaring that providing the social security number is voluntary and not mandatory. Suppose the requesting entity does not provide notice in writing that disclosure is voluntary. In that case, one must assume that providing the number to the requesting entity is mandatory and is by law.

## Page 9 – Requesting Social Security Disclosure Authority

Before disclosing the social security number to any requesting party, whether governmental or non-governmental, one should always ask to see the law that requires mandated disclosure. Failure to provide the law that authorizes such disclosure is grounds to refuse providing the social security number to that requesting entity. If a manager, supervisor, director, or government official states that it is against their company's policy or government procedure to provide the law before the social security number disclosure, the best advice is to immediately walk away from that requesting entity and take business elsewhere. Complying with unlawful requests to provide the social security number to unauthorized individuals leads to identity theft and fraud.

The Privacy Act is supposed to protect the individual; however, the Privacy Act contains certain exceptions permitting agencies to disclose information without the individual's consent. One exception is routine use, which allows a disclosure within the agency and to another agency if compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected. What does "compatible with the purpose" mean? If the social security number was used to obtain a mortgage or a credit card or a driver's license, then the requesting entity can report activity to credit bureaus. However, what if the social security number was used to enroll a child into a public school? What is the compatible purpose for the school to request the social security number? There are no valid reasons for the school to demand the social security number, and disclosure would be an unlawful request.

## Page 10 – Rebutting U.S. Citizenship Presumption

It is optional to have a social security number, and it is certainly optional to have a birth certificate. So why do so many people have the number and the certificate? When asked the question, "Are you a United States citizen?" many people will respond "Yes," having no idea how they even became a United States citizen. The majority of people believe that being born in the United States automatically establishes citizenship status. This is not accurate. Just as providing a birth certificate is optional, becoming a United States citizen is optional as well. The birth certificate, the social security card, and every action thereafter substantiates that the man or woman does agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Benefitting from the United States' protection, benefits, and privileges is the consent needed to change the nationality of the creditor (landlord) into a debtor (tenant).

Once the legal presumption regarding the citizenship trust is rebutted by affidavit or testimony of the man or woman regarding their actual nationality and political status, the United States has no valid claim over the creditor. A man or woman who does not participate in any U.S. benefit or privilege programs and has not accepted any public employment on behalf of the United States is not a U.S. citizen. Unfortunately, most people believe that they are United States citizens and unknowingly claim citizen status every single day without realizing they are doing so.

## Page 11 – Fourteenth Amendment Text and Analysis

The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution states, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." The key phrase is "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." What does subject to the jurisdiction mean? According to Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition, subject means "one that owes allegiance to a sovereign and is governed by his or her laws." The term is used in contradistinction to "citizen." To be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, one must owe allegiance to the United States. Allegiance is defined as the obligation of fidelity and obedience which the individual owes to the government under which he lives or to his sovereign in return for the protection he receives.

A national, who is not a United States citizen, does not owe allegiance to the United States. They owe allegiance to the nation they belong to, which is not the United States. The United States is a corporation, not a nation. Anyone who is born in the geographical United States or its territories but has not sworn allegiance to the United States Corporation is not a United States citizen. Foreign nationals who are born in the United States are perfect examples. They are born in the United States, yet they are not United States citizens because they do not pledge allegiance to the United States. Their parents maintain their child's nationality by never applying for a social security number or birth certificate, thus never subjecting their child to the jurisdiction of the United States.

## Page 12 – Supreme Court Cases on Citizenship

In the Supreme Court case Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U.S. 94 (1884), the Court held that a Native American who voluntarily separated himself from his tribe and took up residence among white citizens was not a citizen of the United States under the Fourteenth Amendment because he was not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States when he was born. The court stated:

The evident meaning of these last words is, not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction, and owing them direct and immediate allegiance. Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States, members of, and owing immediate allegiance to, one of the Indian tribes, (an alien though dependent power,) although in a geographical sense born in the United States, are no more 'born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' within the meaning of the first section of the fourteenth amendment, than the children of subjects of any foreign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born within the United States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign nations. (Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U.S. 94, 102 (1884))

## Page 13 – United States v. Wong Kim Ark

Another important Supreme Court case is United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898). Wong Kim Ark was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who were subjects of the Emperor of China but were domiciled in the United States. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark was a United States citizen by birth under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Court's decision rested on the fact that his parents, although foreign nationals, were permanent residents who were engaged in business in the United States and were not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity by the Chinese government. The Supreme Court distinguished between children born in the United States to foreign ambassadors, public ministers, or alien enemies in hostile occupation, who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, versus children born to alien parents domiciled and doing business in the United States.

The key distinction is that Wong Kim Ark's parents had established domicile in the United States, were engaged in lawful business, and had subjected themselves to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the United States. They were not merely transient visitors. The Court stated that "every person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, becomes at once a citizen of the United States" but emphasized that being subject to the jurisdiction means complete jurisdiction, not merely partial or territorial jurisdiction.

## Page 14 – Domicile and Jurisdiction

The concept of domicile is crucial to understanding jurisdiction. Domicile is not the same as residence. According to Black's Law Dictionary, domicile is "that place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning." Residence, on the other hand, simply means living in a particular locality. A person can have multiple residences but only one domicile. When someone establishes domicile in the United States or one of its territories and accepts the benefits, protections, and privileges of the United States government, they subject themselves to the complete jurisdiction of the United States and become United States citizens if born there.

However, if someone maintains their domicile outside the United States, even if temporarily residing within U.S. territory, they do not subject themselves to the complete jurisdiction of the United States. This is why children of foreign diplomats and ambassadors, even if born on U.S. soil, are not United States citizens. Their parents maintain domicile in their home country and have not subjected themselves to U.S. jurisdiction. The same principle applies to any national. If a man or woman born in the geographical United States maintains their domicile in their nation and has not accepted U.S. benefits and privileges, they are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and are not United States citizens.

## Page 15 – Rebutting the Presumption Through Affidavit

The United States government presumes that anyone born in its territories with a birth certificate and social security number is a United States citizen subject to its complete jurisdiction. This presumption can be rebutted. A man or woman can declare their true national political status through a written affidavit. An affidavit is a written statement made under oath before a notary public or other official authorized to administer oaths. When properly executed and recorded, an affidavit stands as truth unless successfully rebutted by another affidavit with superior evidence.

An affidavit of national political status should clearly state that the man or woman is not a United States citizen, has not voluntarily accepted U.S. citizenship, has not sworn allegiance to the United States Corporation, does not accept benefits and privileges from the United States, maintains domicile in their nation, and operates exclusively in the private capacity. The affidavit should rescind any previous presumed citizenship status, cancel any implied contracts with the United States government, and declare the individual's true nationality. Once properly executed and recorded, this affidavit rebuts the government's presumption of U.S. citizenship and places the burden on the government to provide evidence to the contrary.

# Chapter Three – Existence Of Life

## Page 1 – Life, Death, and Legal Existence

What is life? More importantly, what is legal existence? In the legal world, there are significant differences between biological life and legal existence. A man or woman has biological life from the moment of birth until death. However, legal existence can begin and end at different times than biological life. The government has created a system where legal persons (corporations, trusts, estates) can exist separately from natural persons (men and women). Understanding this distinction is crucial to comprehending how the United States government manages to control its citizens.

When a child is born, a living man or woman enters the world. This natural person has inherent unalienable rights given by the Creator. These rights exist regardless of any government recognition. However, when that birth is registered with the government through a birth certificate, a separate legal entity is created. This legal entity is a trust, and the trust has a different type of existence than the natural man or woman. The trust exists in the legal realm, whereas the man or woman exists in the natural realm.

## Page 2 – Natural vs Legal Existence

The natural realm is governed by natural law, also known as God's law or biblical law. Natural law recognizes that all men and women are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No government can grant these rights because they are inherent to being human. No government can take away these rights except as punishment for crime. Natural law is supreme over all man-made laws.

The legal realm, on the other hand, is governed by statutes, codes, regulations, and executive orders created by governments. These laws apply to legal entities such as corporations, trusts, estates, and legal fictions. Legal entities only have privileges granted by the government that created them. These privileges can be modified, restricted, or revoked at any time by the grantor government. When a man or woman acts as a legal entity (such as a United States citizen), they subject themselves to all the legal realm's statutes and codes.

## Page 3 – The Cestui Que Vie Trust System

The creation of the legal entity through birth registration is accomplished through the ancient trust law concept called Cestui Que Vie, which means "he who lives" in Norman French. The Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666 was enacted by the English Parliament to address property rights when individuals disappeared or were lost at sea. After seven years, if a person did not return, they could be declared legally dead, and their estate could be administered by trustees.

This same principle is applied today when a birth certificate is issued. The government presumes that the man or woman is lost at sea (under admiralty/maritime law) and creates a trust to manage their estate. The ALL CAPS name on the birth certificate represents the trust, not the living man or woman. The trust is considered a deceased estate, which is why the name appears in all capital letters, signifying a corporation or legal fiction rather than a living being.

## Page 4 – Three Parties of the Trust

In every trust, there are three parties: the grantor (also called creator, settlor, or trustor), the trustee, and the beneficiary. When a birth is registered, the living man or woman becomes the grantor of the trust because their biological existence gave rise to the trust's creation. The ALL CAPS legal fiction becomes the trustee, who holds legal title to the trust property and is responsible for managing the trust according to its terms. The United States government positions itself as both a beneficiary and the administrator/guardian of the trust.

However, the living man or woman is also intended to be a beneficiary of the trust. The problem is that most people are never informed that this trust exists or that they have any rights as beneficiaries. Instead, they are led to believe that they are the ALL CAPS name and must act as the trustee, carrying out all the obligations imposed by the United States government. When someone uses their social security number, obtains a driver's license, registers to vote, or accepts any government benefits, they are acting as the trustee of the trust and subjecting themselves to all the legal requirements imposed on trustees.

## Page 5 – Claiming Beneficiary Status

If the living man or woman never claims their position as beneficiary and never directs the trustee (the ALL CAPS legal fiction) on how to operate, then the United States government will continue to act as the administrator and primary beneficiary of the trust. The government will use the trust's assets (the labor and property of the living man or woman) for its own purposes. This is why taxation is considered legal and why the government can seize property, garnish wages, and enforce compliance with endless statutes and regulations.

However, if the man or woman learns the truth about the trust and makes a proper claim as beneficiary and grantor, they can take control of the trust and direct its operation. This is accomplished through affidavits, declarations, and proper notice to the government. Once the living man or woman properly claims their position, the government's presumption of authority over the trust is rebutted. The government must then prove its claim to be administrator, which it cannot do if the rightful grantor and beneficiary has asserted their position.

## Page 6 – Death Certificates and Dissolution of Legal Entities

Just as birth certificates create legal existence, death certificates dissolve legal existence. When a man or woman dies, a death certificate is issued, and the ALL CAPS trust is terminated. However, the trust can also be terminated while the man or woman is still biologically alive. If someone properly declares that they are not the ALL CAPS legal fiction and rescind all consent to be treated as the trustee, they effectively dissolve the trust's authority over them.

This is similar to dissolving a corporation. When a corporation is dissolved, it ceases to exist legally, even though the people who created and operated the corporation continue to live. The same principle applies to the ALL CAPS trust. The living man or woman can dissolve their connection to the legal fiction and operate exclusively as a private individual in the natural realm, subject only to natural law and common law, not to the statutes and codes that apply to legal entities in the legal realm.

## Page 7 – Probate and Estate Administration

When someone dies, their estate goes through probate, which is a court-supervised process of administering the deceased person's estate. During probate, all debts are paid, assets are distributed to heirs, and the estate is closed. However, most people do not realize that they are already in probate while they are still alive. The birth certificate trust is essentially an estate in permanent probate, with the government acting as the administrator.

This explains why courts operate under admiralty/maritime jurisdiction when dealing with matters involving United States citizens. Admiralty/maritime law is the law of commerce and contracts, and it deals with legal fictions, trusts, and estates, not with living men and women. When someone appears in court and accepts the name called out by the judge (which is always in ALL CAPS), they are accepting the role of trustee for the deceased estate and agreeing to be subject to admiralty/maritime jurisdiction.

## Page 8 – Common Law vs Admiralty/Maritime Law

There are fundamental differences between common law and admiralty/maritime law. Common law is the law of the land, dealing with living men and women and their unalienable rights. Common law recognizes that all people are equal and that no one has authority over another except through consent or as punishment for harming another. Common law requires an injured party, a victim who has suffered harm or loss. Without an injured party, there is no crime in common law.

Admiralty/maritime law is the law of the sea, dealing with commerce, contracts, and legal entities. Admiralty/maritime law presumes that everyone is involved in commercial transactions and that all interactions are contractual. There does not need to be an injured party for there to be a violation in admiralty/maritime law; violating a statute, code, or regulation is sufficient, even if no one was harmed. Admiralty/maritime law is what allows governments to create victimless crimes such as traffic violations, tax evasion, and regulatory offenses.

## Page 9 – Flags and Jurisdiction

One way to identify which law applies in a court is to observe the flag displayed in the courtroom. A United States flag with a gold fringe indicates that the court is operating under admiralty/maritime jurisdiction. The gold fringe is not part of the official United States flag as described in the Flag Code; it is an additional decoration that signifies military or admiralty/maritime jurisdiction. Courts that operate under common law jurisdiction display the standard United States flag without any fringe or decorative elements.

Most courtrooms in the United States display flags with gold fringe, indicating that they operate under admiralty/maritime jurisdiction. This is because most cases involve United States citizens (legal fictions) rather than living men and women. When someone enters such a courtroom and responds to their ALL CAPS name, they are consenting to admiralty/maritime jurisdiction and agree to be bound by its rules. If someone were to challenge the court's jurisdiction and make it clear that they are a living man or woman operating under common law, not a legal fiction operating under admiralty/maritime law, the court would be required to address the jurisdictional issue.

## Page 10 – Resurrection from Legal Death

The good news is that legal death through the birth certificate trust system is reversible. A man or woman can resurrect themselves from legal death by properly declaring their true status. This requires understanding the difference between the living being and the legal fiction, rescinding all consent to be treated as a United States citizen, reclaiming the position of beneficiary and grantor of any trusts created in their name, and operating exclusively in the private capacity without accepting government benefits or privileges.

This resurrection is accomplished through written declarations, affidavits, and proper notice to government agencies. It requires diligence, study, and careful attention to detail. But it is possible, and many people have successfully reclaimed their true status and operated outside the presumption of United States citizenship. The key is understanding that the legal fiction was created without full disclosure or informed consent, and therefore any implied contract can be rescinded.

# Chapter Four – Persons Not Required To File

## Page 1 – Internal Revenue Code and Filing Requirements

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is the domestic portion of federal statutory tax law in the United States, and it is published as Title 26 of the United States Code (26 U.S.C.). Most people believe that everyone who earns income in the United States is required to file a federal income tax return. However, the IRC itself reveals that this is not accurate. There are specific classes of persons who are required to file, and if someone does not fall into one of those classes, they are not required to file.

According to 26 U.S.C. § 6012(a), the persons required to file income tax returns are: (1) Every individual having gross income which equals or exceeds the exemption amount, except that a return shall not be required of an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States; (2) Every corporation subject to taxation; (3) Every estate with gross income of $600 or more; and (4) Every trust having any taxable income or gross income of $600 or more. Notice that subsection (1) specifically exempts individuals who are not citizens or residents of the United States from the filing requirement.

## Page 2 – Definition of United States for Tax Purposes

A crucial question is: what does "United States" mean in the Internal Revenue Code? Most people assume it means the fifty states plus territories, but that assumption is incorrect. The IRC provides its own definition of "United States" in 26 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(9), which states: "The term 'United States' when used in a geographical sense includes only the States and the District of Columbia." At first glance, this seems to support the common assumption, but we must look at how "State" is defined.

26 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(10) defines "State": "The term 'State' shall be construed to include the District of Columbia, where such construction is necessary to carry out provisions of this title." Additionally, 26 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(39) defines "possessions of the United States" to include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and other territories. The Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between "States," "District of Columbia," and "possessions." When the IRC says "United States" includes "the States," it is referring to federal territories and possessions, not the fifty states of the Union.

## Page 3 – The District of Columbia and Federal Jurisdiction

The District of Columbia was created by the Constitution as the seat of the federal government. It is not one of the states of the Union; it is federal territory under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. According to Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, Congress has the power "To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of Government of the United States."

This exclusive legislative power means that Congress can create any laws it wants for the District of Columbia without the constitutional limitations that apply to the states of the Union. The federal government has jurisdiction over federal territories, federal enclaves, and federal possessions, but it does not have general jurisdiction over the fifty states or the people within those states unless those people have consented to federal jurisdiction by accepting federal privileges, benefits, or employment.

## Page 4 – Federal Employment and Excise Taxes

The federal income tax is an excise tax, not a direct tax. An excise tax is a tax on privileges, activities, or occupations. A direct tax would be a tax on property or existence itself, and the Constitution requires that any direct tax be apportioned among the states according to population. The federal income tax has never been apportioned, which proves it is not a direct tax. Instead, it is an excise tax on the privilege of earning income from federal sources or through federally-connected activities.

Who has federally-connected income? Federal employees, residents of federal territories (District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, etc.), corporations created under federal law, and anyone who voluntarily engages in a federally-privileged activity. For example, someone who accepts Social Security benefits, Medicare, federal grants, or other federal payments has federally-connected income. Someone who works for a federal agency or receives payments from the federal government has federally-connected income. Someone who operates a business using federal licenses or permits has federally-connected income.

## Page 5 – State Citizens vs United States Citizens for Tax Purposes

The Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between "nonresident aliens," "resident aliens," and "citizens or residents of the United States." A state Citizen who is not a United States citizen is classified as a "nonresident alien" for tax purposes. This might seem strange because they are not aliens (foreigners), but that is the term the IRC uses for anyone who is not a "citizen or resident of the United States."

26 U.S.C. § 871 addresses the taxation of nonresident aliens: "There is hereby imposed a tax of 30 percent of the amount received from sources within the United States by a nonresident alien individual as income from fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income." However, this tax only applies to income "from sources within the United States," which means income from federal territories, federal employment, or federally-connected activities. It does not apply to income earned from private sector employment within one of the fifty states.

## Page 6 – The W-4 Form and Employee's Withholding Certificate

Most people who work for private sector employers complete a Form W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate) when they start employment. The W-4 form is used by the employer to determine how much federal income tax to withhold from the employee's paycheck. However, the W-4 form itself is completely voluntary. There is no law requiring anyone to complete a W-4 form.

The instructions for Form W-4 state: "Complete Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your pay." Notice the word "so that" – this is conditional language indicating that the form's purpose is to enable withholding, not to mandate it. The Internal Revenue Code section that addresses withholding, 26 U.S.C. § 3402, states that employers are required to withhold tax from wages "if" the employee has provided a W-4 form. If no W-4 form is provided, the employer has no basis for withholding and cannot withhold.

## Page 7 – Correcting Withholding Status

Many people who learn they are not required to have federal income tax withheld from their pay submit a corrected W-4 form to their employer claiming "EXEMPT" from withholding. However, this can create problems because the employer and the IRS may question the exemption claim. A better approach is to submit a written notice to the employer (not using Form W-4) explaining that the individual is not a "citizen or resident of the United States" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, is not engaged in federally-connected employment, and requests that no federal income tax be withheld from compensation for labor.

This notice should reference the applicable code sections, including 26 U.S.C. § 6012(a)(1)(A), which exempts individuals who are not citizens or residents of the United States from the requirement to file returns, and 26 U.S.C. § 3401(c), which defines "employee" as including "an officer, employee, or elected official of the United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing." If someone does not fall into one of these categories, they are not an "employee" for federal tax withholding purposes.

## Page 8 – The 1040 Form and Voluntary Compliance

The Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return) is the standard form used by most people to file their federal income tax returns. However, like the W-4, the 1040 is completely voluntary. The IRS itself admits that the federal income tax system operates on "voluntary compliance." What does voluntary mean? It means not compelled, not forced, done by choice.

The IRS Publication 17 states: "The U.S. income tax system is based on the principle of voluntary compliance." The IRS frequently uses this phrase, and many people misunderstand it to mean that paying taxes is voluntary. The IRS claims that what is voluntary is the self-assessment and self-reporting (compliance), not the tax itself. However, if filing a return is voluntary, and if payment without a return is impossible, then the entire system is voluntary.

## Page 9 – Revocation of Election and Rescinding Consent

If someone has previously filed tax returns and paid federal income taxes, can they stop? Yes, but it requires properly revoking any previous elections and rescinding any implied consent to be treated as a United States citizen for tax purposes. This is accomplished through written affidavits and notices sent to the IRS, Social Security Administration, and other relevant agencies.

The notice should clearly state that the individual is not a "citizen or resident of the United States" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, has not received income from federal sources, is not engaged in federally-privileged activities, and revokes any and all previous elections to be treated as a United States taxpayer. The individual should also request that the IRS close any taxpayer accounts associated with their name and social security number and confirm that no returns are required to be filed.

## Page 10 – Operating Without a Social Security Number

The most effective way to avoid federal income tax obligations is to never obtain a social security number in the first place. As previously discussed, the social security number is voluntary and is the key that unlocks the door to federal jurisdiction. Without a social security number, there is no way for the IRS to track income, no way for employers to report wages, and no basis for the presumption that someone is a United States citizen subject to federal taxation.

For those who already have social security numbers, it is possible to rescind the number and request that the Social Security Administration cancel the account. This requires submitting written notice explaining that the application for the social security number was made without full disclosure of the voluntary nature of the program, without informed consent, and under implied duress. The notice should request cancellation of the account and return of all contributions made under the number.

Many people successfully operate without social security numbers by working for private sector employers who respect their status, engaging in private contract labor, operating private businesses, and avoiding all federal benefits and privileges. These individuals do not file tax returns, do not pay federal income taxes, and are not required to do so because they are not "persons" subject to the Internal Revenue Code.

# Chapter 5 - Eradicating Public Debt

## Page 1 - Introduction to Lawful Money and the 1933 Gold Confiscation

Most would argue whether or not there is Lawful Money circulating in today's economic system. In 1933, the United States corporation asked the people to turn in all of their gold and silver and give it to the U.S. Treasury. The U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 5, states,

To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;

And Section 10, Clause 1 reads,

No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;

The Treasury, permitted by the Constitution, is only allowed to issue precious metals in gold and silver coins as tender of payment. In the year 2021, gold and silver coins are not issued by banks or traded in any market as a form of payment for services; but instead, the United States circulates Federal Reserve notes, better known as cash or fiat paper. All fiat paper printed from 1933 and beyond has the specific language stating, "THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE."

## Page 2 - Federal Reserve Notes and Legal Tender

It would make sense that due to the confiscation of all gold and silver and circulating fiat currency, the Treasury has all lawful money. For the people to have this lawful money, the people must use the Treasury to get it. Lawful money cancels out public debt created by interest applied to negotiable instruments. Gold and silver is a fixed weight of value and, therefore, not negotiable such as Federal Reserve notes. There are two sides to the dollar bill: a public and private side to the Federal Reserve note.

Before 1933, all paper bills displayed a different language than all 1933 and beyond paper bills. Within any search engine, there are images of "lawful money of the United States." There are bills in the images, such as a five-dollar bill issued in 1928, which says REDEEMABLE IN GOLD DEMAND AT THE UNITED STATES TREASURY, OR IN GOLD OR LAWFUL MONEY AT ANY FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. This wording comes from Title 12, Banks and Banking, Chapter 3, Federal Reserve System, Subchapter XII. Federal Reserve notes, section 411.

## Page 3 - Columbus Dental Manufacturing Company and the Gold Reserve Act

In July of 1933, the Columbus Dental Manufacturing Company submitted an application to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland in the amount of $10 grand worth of precious metals. The bank approved the application in just one day of submitting the application, acquiring 476.92 ounces of gold and valued at $9,867.14. In the depths of the Great Depression, anyone would question why was the Cleveland Fed supplying gold to an unsuccessful firm rather than supplying gold coins and gold-backed currency to banks? Does the Federal Reserve supply gold to any business today?

The answer to these questions revolves around President Roosevelt's gold program, which began in 1933. It first restricted the private use of gold, requiring businesses like Columbus to apply to the Fed for precious metals. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 was signed by President Roosevelt in January of 1934, which transferred ownership of all precious metals in the U.S. to the Treasury, according to Section 2 of the Act. Monetary gold included all coins and bullion held by individuals and institutions, including the Federal Reserve. In return, the individuals and institutions received currency at a rate of $35 per ounce of gold. This rate reduced the gold value of the dollar to 59 percent of the value set by the Gold Act of 1900, which equaled $20.67 per ounce. That rate had prevailed until the spring of 1933, when the Roosevelt administration began its campaign to devalue the dollar.

## Page 4 - The Glass-Steagall Act and Banking Reform

The Glass-Steagall Act effectively separated commercial banks from the process of investment banking and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), among other public programs. It was one of the most debated legislative initiatives that President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law in June 1933. According to the Federal Reserve History,

In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression, Congress was concerned that commercial banking operations and the payments system were incurring losses from highly volatile equity markets. An important motivation for the Act was the desire to restrict the use of bank credit for speculation and direct bank credit into what Glass and others thought to be more productive uses, such as industry, commerce, and agriculture.

In response to these concerns, the main provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 effectively separated commercial banking from investment banking. Senator Glass was the driving force behind this provision. Commercial banks, which took in deposits and made loans, were no longer allowed to underwrite or deal in securities, while investment banks, which underwrote and managed securities, were no longer allowed to have close connections to commercial banks, such as overlapping directorships or common ownership.

## Page 5 - Federal Deposit Insurance and Banking Protection

Another relevant provision of the Act created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC, which insures bank deposits with a pool of money collected from banks. This provision was the most controversial at the time and drew veto threats from President Roosevelt. It was included at Steagall's insistence, who had the interest of small rural banks in mind. Small rural banks and their representatives were the leading proponents of deposit insurance. Opposition came from large banks that believed they would end up subsidizing small banks.

Past attempts by states to install deposit insurance had been unsuccessful because of moral hazard and because local banks were not diversified. After the bank holiday, the public showed vast support for insurance, partly hoping to recover some of the losses and partly because many blamed Wall Street and big bankers for the Depression. Although Glass had opposed deposit insurance for years, he changed his mind and urged Roosevelt to accept it. A temporary fund became effective in January 1934, insuring deposits up to $2,500. The fund became permanent in July 1934, and the limit was raised to $5,000. This limit was raised numerous times over the years until reaching the current $250,000.

All Federal Reserve member banks on or before July 1, 1934, were required to become stockholders of the FDIC. No state bank was eligible for membership in the Federal Reserve System until it became a stockholder of the FDIC and became an insured institution, with required membership by national banks and voluntary membership by state banks. Deposit insurance is still viewed as a great success, although the problem of moral hazard and adverse selection came up again during the banking failures of the 1980s. In response, Congress passed legislation that strengthened capital requirements and required banks with less capital to close.

## Page 6 - Federal Reserve Notes as Obligations of the United States

Today's fiat paper currency says, "This note is legal tender for all debts public and private." How exactly does an American obtain a public debt or a private debt? To understand these questions, a couple of definitions that govern the United States dollar are essential and can provide America's remedy for eradicating the national public debt. Title 12 US Code § 411 states,

Federal reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the purposes of making advances to Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. The said notes shall be obligations of the United States and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States or at any Federal Reserve Bank.

Title 12 informs everyone who uses Federal Reserve notes that they are obligations of the United States. If Federal Reserve notes are obligations of the United States, shouldn't the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Treasury and its representatives be responsible for the taxes, customs, and public dues? Public debt originates from negotiable instruments, and private debts are associated with non-negotiable instruments or contracts involving entities not associated with the Federal Reserve, such as private investors.

## Page 7 - Negotiable Instruments and the UCC Definition

The Uniform Commercial Code defines a negotiable instrument as,

2(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order,

When observing any denomination of a Federal Reserve note, it displays a fixed amount of money, and interest can be applied to the fixed amount or not.

(1) is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;

Anyone who possesses any denomination of a Federal Reserve note can exchange the note as soon as it is in the holder's hands.

(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and

Anyone who possesses any denomination of a Federal Reserve note can exchange the note as soon as it is in the holder's hands or anytime in the future.

(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.

The latter explained that any negotiable instrument (fiat paper bill, aka Federal Reserve notes) has no restrictions. Still, it obligates the exchanger, and the exchanger has no other protections of the law. If a negotiable instrument refers to the public side of the dollar bill, it would mean that a non-negotiable instrument is in reference to the dollar bill's private side.

## Page 8 - Non-Negotiable Instruments and Demand Notes

(b) "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.

(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.

(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however, expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.

All bills before 1933 contained a conspicuous statement, stating redeemed in lawful money on demand at the U.S. Treasury or any Federal Reserve Bank. Therefore, they are not negotiable. This is the key to reducing the national public debt. Non-negotiable instruments (demand notes) must be exchanged in every commercial transaction to discharge public debt created by negotiable instruments.

(e) An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and is a "draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both "note" and "draft," a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.

(f) "Check" means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or (ii) a chaser's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order."

(g) "Cashier's check" means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank

## Page 9 - Cashier's Checks and Certificates of Deposit

Take, for example, an American writing a check to the Internal Revenue Service for a payment towards a tax bill. The check would be considered a cashier's check because the I.R.S. is the public side to the U.S. Treasury private sector. They are both the same bank on which the same account is drawn or deposited.

(h) "Teller's check" means a draft drawn by a bank (i) on another bank or (ii) payable at or through a bank.

(I) "Traveler's check" means an instrument that (i) is payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (iii) is designated by the term "traveler's check" or by a substantially similar term, and (iv) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.

(j) "Certificate of deposit" means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.

(U.C.C. § 3-104. Negotiable Instrument)

Take a look at any birth certificate issued from Vital Statics or any Public Health Department that warehouses birth certificate receipts. It will state a banknote at the bottom of the certificate with a series of numbers. The birth certificate is a certificate of deposit within the U.S. stock market on behalf of international bankers and creditors for the United States. Again this pertains to U.S. citizens being listed as human capital on the NASDAQ.

## Page 10 - Senator Traficant on Bankruptcy and Government Reorganization

According to Senator James Traficant, Jr. of Ohio, on March 17, 1993, addressing the House,

Mr. Speaker, we are here now in chapter 11. Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any Bankrupt entity in world history, the U.S. Government. We are setting forth, hopefully, a blueprint for our future. There are some who say it is a coroner's report that will lead to our demise.

(United States Congressional Record March 17, 1993, Vol. #33, page H-1303)

It is an established fact that the United States Federal Government has been dissolved by the Emergency Banking Act, March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. I, Public Law 89-719; declared by President Roosevelt, being bankrupt and insolvent. The receivers of the United States Bankruptcy are the International Bankers, the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. All United States Offices, Officials, and Departments are now operating within a de facto status in name only under Emergency War Powers. This democratic form of Government is an established Socialist/Communist order under a new governor for America. This Act was instituted by transferring and or placing the Office of the Secretary of Treasury to that of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund. Public Law 94-564, page 8, Section HR 13955 reads in part,

The U.S. Secretary of Treasury receives no compensation for representing the United States.

## Page 11 - Federal Reserve Definition of Lawful Money

The Federal Reserve describes what lawful money is and how it is applied to specific case law on its website. It reads,

"Lawful money" is a term used in the Federal Reserve Act, the Act that authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue Federal Reserve notes. The Act states that Federal Reserve notes "shall be obligations of the United States and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank." The Act did not, however, define the term "lawful money," but up until 1913, the only currency issued by the United States that was legally recognized as "lawful money" was various issues of "demand notes" (subsequently known as "old demand notes") and "United States notes" authorized by Congress during the Civil War.

At the time, some currency was not considered legal tender, although it could be used by national banking associations as "lawful money reserves." Thus, the term "lawful money" had a broader meaning than the term "legal tender."

In 1933, Congress changed the law so that all U.S. coins and currency (including Federal Reserve notes), regardless of when issued, constitutes "legal tender" for all purposes. Federal and State courts since then have repeatedly held that Federal Reserve notes are also "lawful money." MILAM V. U.S., 524 F.2D 629 (9TH CIR. 1974), is typical of the federal and State court cases holding that Federal Reserve notes are "lawful money."

## Page 12 - The Milam Case and Lawful Money

In Milam, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed a judgment denying relief to an individual who sought to redeem a $50 Federal Reserve Banknote in "lawful money." The United States tendered Milam $50 in Federal Reserve notes, but Milam refused the notes, asserting that "lawful money" must be gold or silver. The Ninth Circuit, noting that this matter had been put to rest by the U.S. Supreme Court nearly a century before in the Legal Tender Cases.

(JULLIARD V. GREENMAN), 110 U.S. 421 (1884) rejected this assertion as frivolous and affirmed the judgment.

(What is lawful money? How is it different from legal tender? - federalreserve.gov)

Taking a closer look at the Milam case, the Federal Reserve Bank is using to determine what is lawful money and what is not. The Mobley M. Milan, Appellant, v. United States of America et al., Appellees, 524 F.2d 629 (9th Cir. 1974) is a memorandum before Kilkenny and Trask, Circuit Judges and Craig,* District Judge:

Appellant has filed a substantial brief and an adequate reply brief and has argued his full share of allowed time insupportable for a demand that his $50.00 Federal Reserve Banknote be redeemed in "lawful money" of the United States, which he says, in effect, must be gold or silver. Appellant refused appellees' tender of an equivalent value in Federal Reserve notes.

Appellant's contentions, in our view, were put to rest close to a century ago in Julliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421, 448, 4 S. Cti. 122, 130, 28 L. Ed. 204 (1884), in which it was said:

"… Under the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and to issue circulating notes for the money borrowed, its power to define the quality and force of those notes as currency is as broad as the like power over a metallic currency under the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof. Under the two powers, taken together, Congress is authorized to establish a national currency, either in coin or in paper, and to make that currency lawful money for all purposes, as regards the national Government or private individuals…"

## Page 13 - Court Ruling on Federal Reserve Notes

While we agree that golden eagles, double eagles, and silver dollars were lovely to look at and delightful to hold, we must at the same time recognize that time marches on and that even the time-honored silver dollar is no longer available in its last bastion of defense the brilliant casinos of the houses of chance in the State of Nevada. Appellant is entitled to redeem his note, but not in precious metal. Simply stated, we find his contentions frivolous.

Judgment affirmed.

The appellant did not realize that the Federal Reserve note has two sides. The Supreme Court informed the appellant that the Constitution is the contract that allows them to determine what is lawful money and what is not. According to contract law and the terms of the law, both cases mentioned, the Federal Reserve has determined that Federal Reserve notes are lawful money and equal to that of gold and silver, as long as they are used as treasury notes on the private side. Depending on the user's knowledge and understanding of the Federal Reserve note, it will determine its tender of payment. Whether it is a negotiable instrument on the public side with interest or a non-negotiable demand note on the private side without interest. The dollar bill has two sides; the public side is a Federal Reserve note, and the private side is a U.S. Treasury demand note.

## Page 14 - The Four Corner Rule and Contract Law

Upon looking at a dollar bill, it may not be noticeable how contract law applies in this manner. The words Federal Reserve note is located at the top of the bill in a black box, referring to the four corner rules. In contract law, the four-corner rule simply stipulates that if two parties enter into a written agreement, they cannot use oral or implied agreements in court to contradict the terms of the written agreement. It is the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury, who are the two parties entering into an agreement, which removes their responsibilities or liabilities for the instrument, transferring its liability to whoever uses the instrument as a negotiable instrument.

There are two signatures on every denomination of a Federal Reserve note, one for the Treasurer of the United States and the other for the Secretary of Treasury. Keep in mind; the Secretary of Treasury is now the Governor for the International Monetary Fund, which is the public side to the actual U.S. Treasury. Therefore the Treasurer of the United States is the actual Treasurer of the private side.

Reducing the public debt is obtainable by steering away from Federal Reserve notes as the beginning and end to Americans' daily commerce. The issuer must reserve their rights upon their signature when using lawful money. Although a Federal Reserve note is already signed by the Treasurer of the U.S. and the Secretary of Treasury (Governor of IMF), American's are not supposed to reserve their rights on the actual Federal Reserve note but instead, on their own demand notes, checks, or whenever using credit cards.

## Page 15 - Converting Federal Reserve Notes to Lawful Money

Simply, exchange Federal Reserve notes for United States Postal Money Orders or money orders or checks issued by any Federal Reserve bank such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc. and add the conspicuous statement of Title 12 U.S.C. § 411, that was once provided on all United States denominational bills before 1933 in the memo section. The imperative language is "Redeemed in Lawful Money or on-demand at the U.S. Treasury or at any Federal Reserve bank," and provides a signature followed by the words All Rights Reserved. This is called a restricted endorsement, which removes the obligation from the public and puts the obligation back onto the United States Corporation to reduce the national public debt lawfully. The U.C.C. informs everyone that unless the conspicuous statement and or rights are reserved, the person using the instrument is held responsible.

(a) If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract. If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the "authorized signature of the represented person," and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the instrument.

(b) If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:

1. If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument.

(U.C.C. § 3-402 Signature By Representative)

## Page 16 - Treasury Signatures and Liability

When the Treasurer of the United States and the Secretary of Treasury sign a negotiable instrument (i.e., dollar bill), which is a contract, without restricting their rights, they become responsible for the debt attached to the dollar bill. This is why Title 12 U.S.C. § 411 states that all forms of money are the United States' obligations. Since many Americans are using negotiable instruments (dollar bills) without restricting their rights (restricted endorsement) on their demand notes such as money orders or checks, Americans become responsible for the national public debt, through the fourteenth amendment fictitious ens legis as one of the entities called the States United. This is how the Government is off the hook from all liability and can tax the U.S. citizen and their children to pay down extreme amounts of debt.

All checks linked to any checking account at any bank will have a section for the issuer to sign their name on the provided line. What's interesting is that line is not a line at all. If zoomed in closely, the words "authorized representative" can be seen, followed by the letters MP, meaning Micro Print. Anyone who signs their name without restricting their rights becomes responsible for the negotiable instrument they are creating.

The national public debt is not entirely the federal Government's fault. Unfortunately, it is the fault of the American people. Americans have been given a choice from the Federal Government to use any Federal Reserve note as a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable demand note. There is no budget plan discussed in political campaigns that will magically reduce the national debt.

## Page 17 - National Debt Statistics and Legal Limitations

The national debt in North America has increased more than 21% since President Trump took office in January of 2017, with the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio approaching 110% in 2019. Under President Obama's administration, the national debt increased 100%, from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. As of April 13, 2020, the U.S. government debt is up to $24.22 trillion. It is codified within Title 31, Money and Finance subsection 3101, that the public debt is limited. The face amount of obligation issued and the face amount of obligations whose principals and interest are guaranteed by the United States Government may not be more than $14,294,000,000,000. That is $9,926,000,000,000 over the legal public debt limitations.

It is easy to understand why so many Americans (beyond politicians and economists) are starting to pay close attention to this issue. Unfortunately, how the debt level is explained to the public is usually glossed over. Pair this problem with the fact that many individuals do not understand how the national debt level affects them on a daily basis, including their future generations.

Regarding banking, most Americans are misinformed of the workings of the Federal Reserve System or how money is circulated in the United States economy. It all starts with politicians requesting to be put into office, promising to provide more free benefits to the public than the opposition. The main issue the politician faces is the need for more money to provide the promised free stuff. However, the State spends more than its income, which is called Deficit Spending.

## Page 18 - Treasury Bonds and the Creation of Debt

To pay for that deficit spending, the Treasury borrows currency by issuing a bond. A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower. It could be thought of as an IOU. Between the lender and the borrower, that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Treasury bonds are indeed the national public debt, stealing prosperity from the future for spending today, to be paid in the form of taxes. The American people could put an end to it by merely using non-negotiable instruments.

Once the bond is created, the Treasury then holds a bond auction, and the world's largest banks compete to buy a large part of the national debt and make a profit by earning interest. After the auction, the banks enter an open market operation to sell the bonds to the Federal Reserve for their profit. To pay for the bonds, the Federal Reserve begins to write a check on an account with nothing in it. According to the Boston Federal Reserve Bank,

"When people write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our account to cover the check, but when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money."

The Federal Reserve then delivers the bad checks to the banks, and at this point, currency comes into existence. The big banks then use that currency to buy more bonds at the next Treasury auction. What is a check? A check is surprisingly an IOU for cash, requiring the receiver to go to the bank and pick it up. In all actuality, the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve exchange IOUs, enriching the banks as middlemen and indebting the people. This is the origination of all of the paper fiat currency!

## Page 19 - Government Spending and Money Circulation

The Treasury then deposits the newly created currency to several government branches, and the Government then proceeds to deficit spending, which is directed to public works, social services, and wars. The employees of Government, hospitals, local school districts, and others then deposit their paychecks into local commercial banks or institutions. This is where things get interesting. When an employee deposits their earnings from labor, they are not depositing into an account to be safely held in trust. Instead, the employee is loaning the bank their earnings, and within certain legal limits, the banks can do anything with it to their benefit.

This includes purchasing shares in the stock market or the foreign exchange market and loaning them to the public without giving the employee their fair share of profit. Instead, should the employee choose to keep their earnings in a savings account, the bank sees fit only to give 0.01% to 1% interest back to the employee while the bank made a fortune. At this point, the Federal Reserve System's primary operation comes into play once the employee deposits their earnings.

A process called Fractional Reserve banking is the primary function of all banks in America. It is a system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and available for withdrawal. This happens to expand the economy by freeing capital for lending theoretically. Loan ratios vary from institution to institution.

## Page 20 - Fractional Reserve Banking Example

Using the Target, Inc. employee, Christopher Alexander Wellington, from the previous chapter, as an example to show how earnings affect the economy from a 10% reserve ratio. Suppose Mr. Wellington received a separate bonus check from Target, Inc. for $100 to be deposited into Citibank, N.A. The bank can legally take $90 and loan it out to the public without informing Mr. Wellington. Citibank must hold $10 of his deposit in a reserve account in case Mr. Wellington wants to come back to make a withdrawal. Of course, his withdrawal of the entire $100 comes from a pool of other 10% reserves from other people; these reserves are called vault cash.

How exactly does Mr. Wellington's bank account statement remain a total of $100 as an available balance? Because the bank created a $100 I.O.U. as bank credit in its place. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,

Commercial banks create checkbook money whenever they grant a loan, only by adding new deposit dollars in accounts on their books in exchange for a borrower's IOU.

(Federal Reserve Bank of New York, "I Bet You Thought," p.19)

Under this example, Mr. Wellington's deposit of $100 allowed Citibank to create an additional 10% bank credit of $90, and therefore there is $190 in existence. People take out loans from the bank to buy a house, a car, have operating money for a business plan, or consolidate debt. A borrower who wishes to buy a car then takes out a loan of $90 from the same bank that was created as bank credit from Mr. Wellington's account and pays the seller for the car. Then the seller deposits the $90 into their Wells Fargo account, and their bank then loans out 90% of that deposit, creating another set of bank credits, which would be $81 for a total of $271 in existence.

## Page 21 - Money Creation Through Banking

This process repeats and repeats up to $1,000 bank credit, all backed by just $100 of vault cash. As mentioned before, some reserve ratios are 10%, 3%, and some are 0%. This is where the vast majority of the currency supply in America comes from. In fact, 92%-96% of all currency in existence is created not by the Government but within banks. The result of this currency expansion by the banks is far higher than this example. This tremendous expansion of currency causes the everyday prices of goods and services to act as a sponge on this never-ending expanding supply. The more currency circulating in existence, the more prices rise to use all of the currency equally. This is where inflation is derived; rising prices are nearly a symptom! Sadly this is the entire makeup of America's currency supply. The U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve exchange IOUs printing 4%-8% of the money into existence, and the other 92%-96% is nothing but numbers typed into a computer by the banks as bank credits.

Unfortunately, the American people work for that currency supply, trading moments of their lives, hour by hour, day by day, year by year in exchange for numbers someone printed on pieces of paper or typed into a computer.

In the United States, neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities. Intrinsically, a dollar bill is just a piece of paper; deposits merely book entries. Coins do have some intrinsic value as metal but generally far less than their face value. What, then, makes these instruments - checks, paper money, and coins - acceptable at face value in payment of all debts and for other monetary uses? Mainly, it is the confidence people have that they will be able to exchange such money for other financial assets and for real goods and services whenever they choose to do so.

(Modern Money Mechanics - A Workbook on Bank Reserves and Deposit Expansion, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)

## Page 22 - The Tax Collection Cycle

The numbers printed or typed now represent Americans' blood, sweat, tears, labor, ideas, and talents so that they can save some of those numbers and pay the tax collector, known as the Internal Revenue Service. The I.R.S. then delivers the taxes over to the U.S. Treasury so that the Treasury can pay the principal and interest on the bonds that the Federal Reserve bought with a check, drawn on an account with NOTHING in it! Much of the taxes collected are not used for schools, public roads, and services but to pay interest on bonds that the Federal Reserve bought with a check drawn on an account with nothing in it.

Is the Federal Reserve committing fraud on the American people, or are the American people unknowingly allowing the Federal Reserve to play their game? Before the establishment of the Federal Reserve, there was no need for personal income tax. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913, and in that very same year, the Constitution was amended to allow income tax, stemming from section 5 of the fourteenth amendment.

How many hours and dollars were siphoned away from Americans and into the hands of the owners of the Federal Reserve? The Federal Reserve bank is not a federal entity at all; it has stockholders. A stockholder is a share of stock representing a percentage of ownership in a corporation; therefore, the stockholders are the owners of that corporation. The Federal Reserve is a private corporation with owners, according to their website, which says,

Appendix B. Dividends

B.1 Payment of Dividends from Surplus

After all necessary expenses of a Federal Reserve bank have been paid or provided for, the stockholders shall be entitled to receive an annual dividend of six per centum on the paid-in capital stock, which dividend shall be cumulative.

(Federal Reserve Act, Section 7. Division of Earnings)

## Page 23 - The Debt Ceiling Paradox

The American people know all too well that whenever the issue of reducing the national debt or talk of the debt ceiling, the federal Government always prints more money or raises taxes to settle the enormous debt. Here's why talk of the debt ceiling is delusional. If the federal government prints the very first dollar into existence and that is the only dollar that exists, but the Government promises to pay it back plus another dollar's worth of interest, where does the Government get the second dollar to pay interest?

The answer is that the Government will have to borrow the second dollar into existence and promise to pay it back with interest. Now there are two dollars that exist, but four dollars is owed, and so on—leading to never enough currency to pay the debt, atlas, not with this method. The only way to stop increasing the national public debt, created by negotiable instruments, is by issuing lawful private money, also known as non-negotiable instruments. But to reduce the current national debt is entirely different.

Title 31, Money and Finance, the U.S. Treasury informs the American people,

(a) To provide the people of the United States with an opportunity to make gifts to the United States Government to be used to reduce the public debt -

(1) the Secretary of the Treasury may accept for the Government a gift of

(A) money made only on the condition that it be used to reduce the public debt;

(B) an obligation of the Government included in the public debt made only on the condition that the obligation be canceled and retired and not reissued;

(Title 31, U.S.C. § 3113. Accepting gifts)

## Page 24 - Discharging Public Debt Through Demand Notes

To discharge the public debt, such as student loans, bank loans, mortgages, etc., the Secretary of Treasury has informed the public of how to successfully aid the Government in debt reduction. Non-negotiable demand notes cancel out negotiable instruments by providing the words of Title 12 U.S.C. § 411. There must also include the words of section (A) of Title 31 U.S.C. § 3113 on the American people's demand notes.

For example, suppose the Target, Inc. employee, Christopher Alexander Wellington, has an auto loan for $16,500 and a monthly payment of $378.47 with Ford Motor Credit. Mr. Wellington has had this loan for three years now and has decided to cancel the obligation of interest affecting the overall national economic health. The first thing Mr. Wellington must do is understand the laws of making conspicuous statements on negotiable instruments. This rule comes from the Uniform Commercial Code, known as Accord and Satisfaction By Use of Instrument.

(b) Unless subsection (c) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.

(U.C.C. § 3-311(b))

Every State has encoded this U.C.C. rule into its state code. Being that Mr. Wellington is a Californian National, the state code for accord and satisfaction is CA CIV Code, Chapter 4, Section 1526.

## Page 25 - California Accord and Satisfaction Law

(a) Where a claim is disputed or unliquidated, and a check or draft is tendered by the debtor in settlement thereof in full discharge of the claim, and the words "payment in full" or other words of similar meaning are notated on the check or draft, the acceptance of the check or draft does not constitute an accord and satisfaction if the creditor protests against accepting the tender in full payment by striking out or otherwise deleting that notation or if the acceptance of the check or draft was inadvertent or without knowledge of the notation.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the acceptance of a check or draft constitutes an accord and satisfaction if a check or draft is tendered pursuant to a composition or extension agreement between a debtor and its creditors and pursuant to that composition of the extension agreement, all creditors of the same class are accorded similar treatment, and the creditor receives the check or draft with knowledge of the restriction.

A creditor shall be conclusively presumed to have knowledge of the restriction if a creditor either:

(1) Has, previous to the receipt of the check or draft, executed a written consent to the composition or extension agreement.

(2) Has been given, not less than 15 days nor more than 90 days prior to receipt of the check or draft, notice, in writing, that a check or draft will be tendered with a restrictive endorsement and that acceptance and cashing of the check or draft will constitute an accord and satisfaction.

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the acceptance of a check or draft by a creditor constitutes an accord and satisfaction when the check or draft is issued pursuant to or in conjunction with a release of a claim.

(d) For the purposes of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), mailing the notice by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the address shown for the creditor on the debtor's books or such other address as the creditor may designate in writing constitutes notice.

## Page 26 - Providing Notice to Creditors

According to the law mentioned above, Mr. Wellington first needs to provide the Ford Motor Credit Company a certified mail notice with an attached proof of service, made attention to the Chief Executive Officer. The notice should inform their office will receive a check or draft with a "restrictive endorsement" not less than 15 days or not more than 90 days from the date of receipt of the notice. Once 15 days have passed, and Mr. Wellington has received a returned certified mail receipt with either no response from Ford Motor Credit Company or a positive confirmation, he may begin to provide his non-negotiable demand note with a restrictive endorsement.

Mr. Wellington should use a United States Postal Money Order because of the Post Office's contractual relationship with the United States Treasury via the Post Master General. The Post Office is the closest form of lawful money from the U.S. Treasury that Americans have available. Per Title 39 of the United States codebook, all officers and employees are constitutional officers,

Before entering upon their duties and before receiving any salary, all officers and employees of the Postal Service shall take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation:

"I, , do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter."

(Title 39, U.S.C. § 1011. Oath of office; Pub. L. 91-375, August 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 733)

## Page 27 - Treasury and Postal Service Relationship

Title 39, U.S.C. § 2006. The relationship between the Treasury and the Postal Service reads,

(c) Notwithstanding section 2005(d)(5) or 2011(e)(4)(E) of this title, obligations issued by the Postal Service shall be obligations of the Government of the United States, and payment of principal and interest thereon shall be fully guaranteed by the Government of the United States, such guaranty being expressed on the face thereof, if and to the extent that -

(1) the Postal Service requests the Secretary of Treasury to pledge the full faith and credit of the Government of the United States for the payment of principal and interest thereon; and

(2) the Secretary, in his discretion, determines that it would be in the public interest to do so.

Mr. Wellington has purchased a United States Postal Money Order in the amount equal to his monthly car payment of $378.47. The "pay to the order" would state Ford Motor Credit Company, with its address right below the company name. The memo section is the most crucial, converting the pre-made negotiable instrument to a non-negotiable demand note. The memo should have the following exact language, "Payment in Full For The Reduction of Public Debt Account No. 1234567890 (i.e., car loan account number); Redeemed in Lawful Money on Demand at the U.S. Treasury or at any Federal Reserve bank."

Mr. Wellington would then provide his name, followed by the words "All Rights Reserved," and provides his address right below. The next step is to properly register the demand note as an extension to Mr. Wellington's U.C.C. 1 Financing Statement, as explained in Chapter Three: Existence of Life.

## Page 28 - UCC 3 Financing Statement Amendment

The extension of the uniform commercial code is the form U.C.C. 3 Financing Statement Amendment. Mr. Wellington would provide the initial U.C.C. 1 Financing Statement File No. from the Secretary of State's office in box 1a. Box 3, the option for continuation would be checked, any secured party of record would be checked in box 5, as this continuing statement affects the Express Trust. In box 8, the third option would be checked as giving an entire restated collateral description. Mr. Wellington would provide the full automobile details, the full Ford Motor Credit Company account details (including contract sales date), and a full description of the demand note. The HEINZ WOLFGANG EXPRESS TRUST would be provided in box 9a for the secured party organization name.

The U.C.C. 3 must be directed to the Secretary of State for recording. A certified copy of both the U.C.C. 1 and 3 should be obtained from the Secretary of State, and Mr. Wellington is now prepared to delegate discharge instructions to the United States Post Master General. Both U.C.C. forms, with the actual U.S.P.S. Money Order, and a certified copy of the Declaration of Express Trust (further explained in the upcoming chapters), and lastly, an introductory trustee letter made attention to the Post Master General, with the I.R.S. Form W-8BEN would complete Mr. Wellington's accord and satisfaction discharge packet. The W-8BEN will further be explained as well.

The introductory letter should provide brief detail introducing the foreign express trust as well as advising the postmaster general to register the demand note as a treasury note with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department and forward the demand note to Ford Motor Credit Company in respect to Title 31 U.S.C. 3113, Accepting Gifts. The Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service can receive the packet at 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, D.C.

## Page 29 - Debt Reduction and 1099-C Settlement

That's it! Once Mr. Wellington sends the payment to Ford Motor Credit Company, and they have cashed the money order, his $16,500 obligation of the United States has just been canceled, reducing the national debt minus $16,500 and would then receive a 1099-C from the lender. The HEINZ WOLFGANG EXPRESS TRUST must settle the amount reported in the 1099-C by using the same method or by sending an Explanatory Statement to the I.R.S. stating that the entity is not required to file nor pay taxes. The I.R.S. will definitely need the trust to cancel the amount provided in the informational 1099-C to clear their books, or else it will be considered as an income to Mr. Wellington's social security account.

A mortgage or credit card payment would operate just the same. In the event that one is in the middle of purchasing an automobile using an installment sales contract or at the closing table regarding real estate, a restrictive endorsement is still required to help reduce the national public debt. All installment sales contracts and mortgage promissory notes are obligations of the United States, just waiting to be circulated from one party to another as a negotiable instrument. Adding the language "Redeemed in Lawful Money on Demand at the U.S. Treasury or at any Federal Reserve bank" with a signature, followed by the words "All Rights Reserved," will most assuredly prevent a negotiable instrument.

If all Americans proceeded to issue demand notes in all areas of commercial transactions, with the intent to discharge the public debt to stop assuming liability for the use of Federal Reserve notes, the national debt could be eradicated in no time at all. The Federal Reserve note is legal tender for all debts, public and private. All paper fiat currency bills have two sides. A public side from the use of negotiable instruments requires interest, and a private side from the use of non-negotiable instruments that have no interest but act as lawful money and or treasury notes.

## Page 30 - United States Coin as Lawful Money

Besides the United States Postal Service offering Americans the best access to the United States Treasury, there is also the United States Coin. The majority are led to believe that the Federal Reserve has all the power to create money when indeed, all the power they have is to print Federal Reserve notes but never to coin money. Minting coin has always been the responsibility of the United States Treasury per the constitution. Despite the smallest amounts of silver, gold, and copper in the current U.S. coin, it will always hold more value than a Federal Reserve note.

An article entitled "Contracts Payable in Gold," by George Cyrus Thorpe, Showing the Legal Effect of Agreements to Pay in Gold – Senate Resolution No. 62, April 17, 1933, quotes,

The laws of the United States recognize two kinds of money, namely coin, and paper. The term "dollars in species" means gold or silver coined dollars. "Dollars in currency" means dollars in notes or any paper money current in the community.

(Trebilcock v. Wilson (1872) 12 Wall. 687, 20 L. Ed. 460)

As of today, the current median income is $34,466 in North America, which is $2,872.17 per month that the average household is bringing in to support their families. Back in 1913, the dollar to gold ratio was just $29.01, and today, one gold dollar is still measured by the same gold dollar value, which was used in 1849 to 1889, weighing in at 1.672 grams or 0.04837 troy ounces. One gold dollar is equal to $91.91.

## Page 31 - True Value of Income in Gold

So, if gold and silver are the standards for real tangible money that will never lose its value in contrast to paper fiat money, and if the average family brings in $2,872.17 fiat per month; then in actuality, an average family truly brings in just $31.25 of gold per month. As stated before, if all Americans proceeded to issue demand notes in all areas of commercial transactions, with the intent to discharge the debt to stop assuming liability for the use of Federal Reserve notes, the national debt could be eradicated in no time at all.

One final thought in relation to the National Public Debt, which is highly talked about every year, especially in the year 2020 with the wide-spread of the Global Economic Pandemic, known as COVID-19; is that the name of a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident, or Legal Permanent Resident and its Social Security Number or ITIN, creates the securities needed for the federal government to then package those securities into bonds to be sold around the world to investors. All U.S. citizens have been naturalized via the birth certificate. All birth certificates have a listed Registrar or Assessor Clerk, and according to Title 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(7), the term "clerk of court" means a clerk of a naturalization court.

As the bonds are sold, the federal government cannot get away with 100% of fraud, earning a profit from the U.S. citizens labor; therefore, the government gives a portion of the securities to its citizens on the private side called the CAFR funds and given to the citizens on the public side via old-age insurance, workers compensation, social security insurance, 401k, Medi-Cal, Medicare and other means of public insurance. Every created security goes into the CAFR accounts in the county and continues to grow.

## Page 32 - The Debt Clock and Estate Inheritance

Whenever there's talk about the debt ceiling or debt clock in New York City, it is money ($27 Trillion) that is owed to nationals on the private side of the ledger and ($27 Trillion) of dischargeable debt on the public side. The private side is also inheritance funds that are uncollectable unless the national operates completely in trust in the name of their forefathers and foremothers of the Mehomitan Nation, which means the national is descendible who is able to collect what is rightfully theirs. Only nationals of an Express Trust, a.k.a Natural Persons, can own property fully protected by the United States Constitution "contract clause."

Section 1. The rights protected by the Constitution of the United States are the rights of natural persons only. Artificial entities, such as corporations, limited liability companies, and other entities, established by the laws of any State, the United States, or any foreign state shall have no rights under this Constitution and are subject to regulation by the People, through Federal State, or local law. The privileges of artificial entities shall be determined by the People through Federal, State, or local law and shall not be construed to be inherent or inalienable.

(116th Congress 1st Session, H.J. Resolution 48, February 22, 2019)

# Chapter 6 - Credit Secrets, Investing & Banking

## Page 1 - The Changing Economy and Two Monetary Systems

The economy is changing, and it is changing rapidly in the eyes of Money. There are precious metals, notes, bonds, certificates, commodities, and most recently, bitcoin (digital dollar and digital wallets) per the 116th Congress, 2D Session, "Financial Protections and Assistance for America's Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act." Even states in America, such as Nevada, Utah and Texas, now mint, and print gold-backed currency exchangeable in their states for goods and services.

Everyone has heard that cash is king; however, this new system is not the case. Credit is king, and the world is preparing for two monetary systems for two types of people. The first system is a credit digital dollar system for all U.S. citizens operating outside of a natural person. The second, precious metals for all nationals operating within a natural person, known as an Express Trust.

Credit is king; therefore, it is wise to review a couple of useful credit tips that any FICO professional would advise.

## Page 2 - Credit Tip #1: Number of Credit Cards

Credit Tip #1; how many credit cards should one have? Well, the answer is as many as possible. The more, the better, but the real question is, what is the minimum amount of credit cards one should have? The answer is three credit cards. FICO (the Fair Isaac Company) has implemented a scoring model based on revolving credit as 40% of the entire FICO score, ranking higher than late payments, mortgages, or student loans. The key is to have three credit cards open at all times, with balances maintained at 7% or less.

FICO has figured out that if a borrower can maintain three credit cards under 7%, the likelihood of having a derogatory item over the next 24 months is extremely low, so the score increases. If borrowers go over 7% up to 17%, then the score drops 10 points. It is about 10 points for every 10% of the credit limit. If the limit is 100% maxed, it will lose approximately 100 points.

Credit Tip #2; does canceling credit cards boost the credit score? The answer is an absolute no! Jumping back to the first credit tip, FICO always wants to see at least three credit cards because it shows responsibility. If borrowers closed all accounts and canceled all credit cards, thinking that no credit is good credit, FICO will then view the debtor as an alcoholic that avoids the local bars. In this case, the proper term to use is a "crediholic" (one who abuses credit). FICO will not trust the borrower with credit if they don't trust themselves.

## Page 3 - Credit Card Usage Strategy

It is also good to practice using specific types of credit cards to avoid cancelation. Using VISA or Mastercard pay networks is highly preferred over department store credit cards. Department cards can only be used at the participating stores and not anywhere VISA or Mastercard is accepted. Therefore, it forces the card user to shop more than they need to, and if the card user doesn't make purchases, then the credit card company will decrease the card limit or cancel the account, which will decrease the FICO score drastically. It is best to have three major credit cards that can be used anywhere. One for living expenses, the second for monthly bills, and the third for miscellaneous spendings, such as batteries for the smoke detector or auto repair maintenances.

It is imperative to use credit cards every month sparingly. If the credit user chooses to max the cards to receive the cashback or rewards, pay off or pay down to the 7% or less before the billing cycle ends to keep the FICO score high. If a card is not being used, it is smart to purchase something cheap with the cards once a month so that the credit cards' computers will notice that the card is still used and not cancel the account.

Credit Tip #3; how fast can one's credit score increase? The answer is 45 to 60 days for every positive change made. This is important because if someone is buying a house or trying to qualify for a low-interest rate and their scores are not good enough, they need to know that it will take approximately 60 days for each tip to be applied and reported by the credit card companies. Of course, all credit tips must be sustained over time, and FICO continues to update the scores every month.

## Page 4 - Authorized Users and Credit Building

Credit Tip #4; add authorized users. Adding an authorized user is a great way to build and boost credit scores; however, it is not recommended to add an authorized user on any credit cards that are currently maxed out. Remember that 40% of someone's FICO score comes from revolving credit. The credit report will show which cards are maxed, which cards are almost maxed, and which cards are near perfect. Individuals will notice this when they pull their reports because the balances of each account are what determines the score. Adding an authorized user will give the authorized user the entire history of the card, regardless if they were on the account or not.

For example, if the primary account holder had a Discover Card for ten years and it never was late and always under 7% balance, adding an authorized user on that card will give them ten years of perfect credit. This is also known as "piggybacking" off someone else's credit cards. After 60 days of being added to the account, the FICO score of the authorized user should increase depending on what is currently on the credit report. Most times, parents will add their children to their credit cards to boost their children's scores who have no credit at all. In most cases, a person with no credit will end up with a 720+ FICO score by being an authorized user on three different credit cards.

## Page 5 - Credit Monitoring and Identity Theft

Credit Tip #5; credit monitoring and identity theft. Credit monitoring is very important because it keeps the card user alert in case their information is compromised or if they have forgotten about an account that is about to be closed, or if the bank decides to lower the limit on the card. The card user will be able to see all of the balances on the report update monthly to ensure everything is okay. Most people are misinformed about free credit monitoring services. When a person signs up for free credit services, whether it be Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, etc., the bureaus will pull the person's credit report, and in exchange for free monitoring, the bureaus have the right to sell that information.

As of June of 2017, there were 147.9 million Americans that were affected by one of the largest data breaches in American history, stemming from Equifax, one of the three major credit bureaus. Due to this breach, Equifax had to pay at least $575 million to help people affected by the data breach, requiring Equifax to provide all Americans with access to their reports for free for up to ten years. Under normal circumstances without the breach, Americans can still get their reports three times a year from each bureau absolutely free at www.annualcreditreport.com.

This website is endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission, and there is no catch. AnnualCreditReport.com does not try to sell anything; it is just a simple report. The bureaus are required by law to give everyone their reports at least three times a year without damaging their credit score. This website does not use a hard inquiry; instead, it is called a soft inquiry. The difference between a hard inquiry and a soft inquiry is that a hard inquiry is from a lender or creditor in the process of approving a credit card or loan. A soft inquiry is just for viewing purposes only.

## Page 6 - Types of Credit Inquiries

According to MyFICO.com, inquiries can be categorized as either hard or soft. Hard inquiries appear on a person's credit report whenever they authorize a lender to check their credit, such as when applying for a loan or credit card. This happens even if the application is denied. These inquiries can temporarily decrease one's credit score by a few points. Soft inquiries, on the other hand, occur when the account holder's credit report is pulled for reasons not related to a credit application, such as when they check their own report or a lender pre-approves them for an offer. Soft inquiries do not affect the score.

Therefore, checking one's own credit doesn't hurt the score. Reviewing credit reports regularly is a great way to understand how creditors view an individual. Credit card companies and banks expect their customers to monitor their credit to prevent fraud and identity theft. In general, account holders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that appear on their account, as long as the account holder reports them promptly. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, liability for unauthorized use of a credit card is capped at $50. Many credit card companies have $0 liability policies, so victims of identity theft or fraud often do not have to pay anything. However, individuals must examine credit reports and bank statements regularly to detect and report fraudulent activity.

## Page 7 - Disputing Credit Report Errors

Credit Tip #6; dispute letters to the credit bureaus. If someone notices information on their credit report that is incorrect, outdated, or incomplete, they can dispute it. First, contact the credit reporting agency to inform them about the information thought to be incorrect, and second, inform the information provider (the creditor) about the error. The credit bureaus have 30 to 45 days to investigate the dispute.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, credit reporting agencies and the creditor that provided the information both have legal responsibilities to correct inaccurate or incomplete information. To protect all rights under the law, contact both the credit reporting agency and the information provider. The FTC states that disputed information must be investigated and deleted or corrected if found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. Credit bureaus cannot report outdated negative information. In most cases, credit bureaus cannot report negative information that is more than seven years old or bankruptcies that are more than ten years old.

There is a rumor circulating that if someone disputes anything on their credit reports, the bureau will just automatically remove the item because it would cost too much for them to investigate. This is false! The credit bureau will always verify the debt with the creditor, and if the creditor responds within 30 to 45 days, the debt will remain on the credit report. The correct method to get anything removed from the credit report is to have the creditor send a letter to the credit bureau in which they want the account deleted. It would be wise for anyone who has taken the steps of discharging the public debt via lawful money, explained in Chapter Five: Eradicating Public Debt, to request the creditor to send letters of deletion to all three credit bureaus to have proof that the accounts have been paid in full.

## Page 8 - Dealing with Collection Agencies

Credit Tip #7; collection agencies will also affect the credit score. Just because a creditor sent the account to collections does not mean the collections agency owns the debt. The creditor is still the owner of the debt; however, the collection agency acts as a collector to collect on the behalf of the creditor. Keep in mind that any collection account on a credit report will hurt the FICO score.

There are many types of collection agencies, but the two most common are first-party and third-party debt collectors. First-party collectors are usually a subsidiary of the original creditor, while third-party collectors work for a debt collection agency. There are unique requirements that one must follow when addressing collections, better known as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, a debt collector, as stated before, may not harass, oppress, or abuse anyone. For example, debt collectors may not use threats of violence or harm; publish a list of people who refuse to pay their debts (except to a credit bureau); use obscene or profane language; or repeatedly use the phone to annoy someone. Debt collectors may not use false or misleading statements when collecting a debt. For example, debt collectors may not falsely represent themselves as attorneys or government representatives; falsely imply someone committed a crime; falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit bureau; misrepresent the amount owed; indicate that papers sent are legal forms when they are not; or indicate that papers sent are not legal forms when they are.

## Page 9 - Rights Under Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

Debt collectors also may not state that someone will be arrested if they do not pay their debt; state they will seize, garnish, attach, or sell the property or wages unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so and it is legal to do so; give false credit information about anyone to anyone, including a credit bureau; send anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency when it is not; or use a false name.

Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, collectors may not collect any amount greater than the debt unless the state law permits such a charge; deposit a post-dated check prematurely; use deception to make someone accept collect calls or pay for telegrams; take or threaten to take property unless this can be done legally; or contact someone by postcard.

Most people think the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act only applies to third-party agencies; however, within the "Definitions" located in 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6), the Act includes within its definition of "debt collector" any creditor who, in the process of collecting his own debts, uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts. Therefore, the creditors must also adhere to the rules of the F.D.C.P.A.

## Page 10 - Collection Statute of Limitations

Credit Tip #8; old debts and the statute of limitations. Many Americans are dealing with debt collectors about debts so old that they can no longer be reported on a credit report or used to sue a person via state law. The statute of limitations is a law that limits how long debt collectors can legally sue for payment on certain kinds of debt. The amount of time varies depending on the type of debt and the state the person lives in.

Generally, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, negative information will stay on a credit report for seven years. Certain bankruptcies can stay for ten years, and unpaid tax liens can stay for 15 years. The statute of limitations on debt varies by state and type of debt, ranging from three to 15 years. After that, the debt is "time-barred," meaning a debt collector can no longer sue over the debt, but it can still try to collect it. If someone is contacted by a debt collector about an old debt, the person has the right to request proof that they owe it. Once proof is established and has been verified, provide a letter stating the debt cannot be reported on the credit report due to the statute of limitations and should not have been sent to collections because it is time-barred.

If the debt is beyond the statute of limitations and the debt collector sues, one could respond to the lawsuit with proof that the debt is time-barred, and the debt collector could lose the lawsuit. The law varies from state to state. In some states, if the debtor makes any payment on an old debt or even acknowledges in writing that they owe the debt, the clock resets, and a new statute of limitations period begins. In that case, the debt collector could sue over the debt and could get authorization to garnish wages or put a lien on a home. It is best to consult with an attorney before making a payment on an old debt.

## Page 11 - Building Credit Responsibly

Credit Tip #9; good debt versus bad debt. A general rule in banking is to ensure that any debt acquired is good debt. Good debt is going towards an appreciating asset like a mortgage, whereas bad debt is debt towards a depreciating asset like automobiles. Credit cards can be both good debt and bad debt, depending on what purchases are being made on the cards and how they are being used. Good debt is using credit cards to pay bills under 7% balance and being paid off monthly. Bad debt is maxing out credit cards that are never paid off in full every month. Student loans can also be both good debt and bad debt. Good debt is when the student loans are paying for a valued degree and or occupation, and bad debt is when student loans are for degrees with poor or no occupations.

Credit Tip #10; mortgage hacks. When purchasing a home, it is imperative to shop around for the best interest rates and best mortgage structure. Many mortgage brokers will tell potential homebuyers that purchasing a home with a bigger down payment will result in a lower interest rate. This is true; the more money put down, the less likely the buyer is to abandon the house. In reality, the bigger the down payment, the less likely the bank will earn from interest. Take a $500,000 house, for example, if the buyer puts 20% down ($100,000) and finances $400,000 over a 30-year conventional mortgage at an interest rate of 4.5%, the buyer will pay $328,235.23 in interest over the life of the loan. If the same buyer only puts 5% down ($25,000) and finances $475,000 at the same rate and term, they will pay $389,280.46 in interest.

## Page 12 - Investment Strategy with Mortgages

The difference in interest paid is $61,045.23 over 30 years. This is where the strategy comes in: instead of putting $100,000 down, only put $25,000 down and invest the remaining $75,000 into the stock market or real estate. If that $75,000 grows at an average of 7% annually over 30 years, it would grow to approximately $571,785. Even after paying the extra $61,045.23 in interest, the buyer is still ahead by $510,739.77. This strategy allows the buyer to keep more liquidity, have their money work for them through investments, and still own the same house. The key is discipline in investing the difference and not spending it.

Another mortgage hack is to make bi-weekly payments instead of monthly payments. By paying half the mortgage every two weeks instead of once a month, the homeowner will make 26 half-payments in a year, which equals 13 full monthly payments instead of 12. This extra payment goes directly toward the principal, and over time, it can shave years off the mortgage and save tens of thousands in interest. On a $400,000 loan at 4.5% over 30 years, making bi-weekly payments could save approximately $34,000 in interest and pay off the loan about 4.5 years early.

## Page 13 - Banking Strategies and Asset Protection

Credit Tip #11; use multiple banks and credit unions. It's wise to maintain accounts at multiple financial institutions for several reasons. First, FDIC insurance only covers $250,000 per depositor, per institution. If someone has more than $250,000, spreading it across multiple banks ensures all funds are insured. Second, having accounts at different institutions provides redundancy in case one bank has technical issues, freezes an account, or goes under. Third, different banks offer different benefits—some have better interest rates on savings, others have better credit card rewards, and credit unions often offer lower fees and better loan rates.

The strategy is to use one bank for daily transactions and bill payments, another for savings and emergency funds, and possibly a credit union for auto loans or personal loans. Additionally, keeping funds in an Express Trust account, as explained in upcoming chapters, provides maximum asset protection from creditors, lawsuits, and government seizure.

Credit Tip #12; understand the difference between banks and credit unions. Banks are for-profit corporations owned by shareholders, while credit unions are non-profit organizations owned by their members. This fundamental difference affects everything from fees to interest rates. Credit unions typically offer lower fees, higher interest rates on savings, and lower interest rates on loans. However, banks often have more locations, better technology, and more services. The ideal strategy is to use both: a credit union for loans and savings, and a bank for everyday transactions and advanced services.

## Page 14 - Investment Basics and Compound Interest

Now, shifting focus to investing and wealth building. The most powerful force in wealth building is compound interest. Albert Einstein allegedly called it "the eighth wonder of the world," saying, "He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it." Compound interest is when earnings generate their own earnings. For example, if someone invests $10,000 and earns 10% in the first year ($1,000), they now have $11,000. In year two, they earn 10% on $11,000 ($1,100), bringing the total to $12,100. Over time, this compounding effect creates exponential growth.

The key variables in compound interest are: the principal amount invested, the interest rate or rate of return, the time period, and the frequency of compounding. Starting early is crucial because time is the most powerful variable. Someone who invests $5,000 per year from age 25 to 35 (10 years, $50,000 total) and then stops, will have more at age 65 than someone who invests $5,000 per year from age 35 to 65 (30 years, $150,000 total), assuming the same 10% annual return. The person who started earlier would have approximately $1,645,000, while the person who started later would have approximately $904,000.

## Page 15 - The Rule of 72 and Investment Returns

A useful tool for understanding compound interest is the Rule of 72. To determine how long it takes for money to double at a given interest rate, divide 72 by the interest rate. For example, at 8% annual return, money doubles in 9 years (72 ÷ 8 = 9). At 6%, it takes 12 years. At 10%, only 7.2 years. This rule helps investors quickly assess investment opportunities and understand the time value of money.

Investment vehicles vary in risk and return. The general principle is that higher returns come with higher risk. The main investment categories include: cash and cash equivalents (savings accounts, money market funds, CDs) with low risk and low return (1-3%); bonds (government, corporate, municipal) with moderate risk and moderate return (3-6%); stocks (individual stocks, mutual funds, ETFs) with higher risk and higher return (7-10% average historically); real estate (rental properties, REITs) with moderate to high risk and varying returns (8-12%); and alternative investments (commodities, cryptocurrencies, private equity) with the highest risk and most variable returns.

## Page 16 - Diversification and Asset Allocation

The key to successful investing is diversification and asset allocation. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is more than just a cliché—it's essential risk management. Diversification means spreading investments across different asset classes, industries, and geographic regions. If one investment performs poorly, others may perform well, balancing overall returns. Asset allocation is the process of dividing investments among different asset categories based on goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

A young investor with 30+ years until retirement might have an aggressive allocation: 80% stocks, 15% bonds, 5% cash. Someone nearing retirement might have a conservative allocation: 40% stocks, 50% bonds, 10% cash. The general rule is to subtract one's age from 110 to determine the percentage that should be in stocks (110 - age = % in stocks). So, a 30-year-old would have 80% in stocks, while a 60-year-old would have 50% in stocks.

However, these are just guidelines. Individual circumstances vary. The most important factors are: risk tolerance (can you sleep at night if your portfolio drops 30%?), time horizon (when will you need the money?), financial goals (retirement, buying a house, education?), and current financial situation (emergency fund established, debt paid off?).

## Page 17 - Tax-Advantaged Accounts and Retirement Planning

Tax-advantaged accounts are crucial for wealth building. The government provides significant tax benefits to encourage retirement saving. The main types include:

Traditional IRA/401(k): Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing current taxable income. Money grows tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. For 2021, individuals can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA ($7,000 if age 50+) and $19,500 to a 401(k) ($26,000 if age 50+).

Roth IRA/401(k): Contributions are made with after-tax dollars (no current tax deduction), but money grows tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. This is extremely powerful for young investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

Health Savings Account (HSA): Often called the "triple tax advantage" account. Contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. After age 65, can withdraw for non-medical expenses (taxed as ordinary income, like a traditional IRA). Maximum contribution for 2021 is $3,600 for individuals, $7,200 for families.

The strategy is to maximize contributions to these accounts every year. Someone in the 24% tax bracket who contributes $19,500 to a 401(k) saves $4,680 in taxes that year while building retirement wealth.

## Page 18 - Employer Matching and Free Money

One of the biggest mistakes employees make is not taking full advantage of employer matching in 401(k) plans. If an employer offers to match 50% of contributions up to 6% of salary, that's an immediate 50% return on investment—something impossible to find anywhere else. On a $60,000 salary, contributing 6% ($3,600) gets an additional $1,800 from the employer—literally free money. Not taking full advantage of employer matching is leaving money on the table.

The recommended strategy is: (1) Contribute enough to get full employer match, (2) Max out Roth IRA, (3) Max out HSA, (4) Go back and max out 401(k), (5) Invest in taxable brokerage account. This order optimizes tax benefits and free employer money.

## Page 19 - Index Funds vs. Active Investing

One of the most important investment decisions is choosing between index funds and actively managed funds. Study after study shows that index funds—which simply track a market index like the S&P 500—outperform about 80-90% of actively managed funds over the long term, especially after accounting for fees.

Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, recommends index funds for most people. He has said, "A low-cost index fund is the most sensible equity investment for the great majority of investors." His reasoning is simple: trying to beat the market through stock picking or active management is extremely difficult, expensive (high fees), and rarely successful over long periods.

Index funds have several advantages: ultra-low fees (often 0.03-0.10% vs. 1-2% for active funds), broad diversification (own the entire market), tax efficiency (low turnover means fewer capital gains), and consistent long-term returns (match the market return, which historically averages about 10% annually for the S&P 500).

The simple three-fund portfolio recommended by Vanguard founder John Bogle consists of: Total Stock Market Index Fund (domestic stocks), Total International Stock Market Index Fund (foreign stocks), and Total Bond Market Index Fund (bonds). Adjust the allocation based on age and risk tolerance, rebalance annually, and ignore short-term market noise.

## Page 20 - Dollar-Cost Averaging and Market Timing

One of the most common questions investors ask is "When should I invest?" The answer is now, and then keep investing regularly regardless of market conditions. This strategy is called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and it removes emotion from investing while taking advantage of market volatility.

Dollar-cost averaging means investing a fixed amount at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly) regardless of market price. When prices are high, the fixed amount buys fewer shares. When prices are low, it buys more shares. Over time, this results in a lower average cost per share than trying to time the market.

Why doesn't market timing work? Because it requires being right twice—when to get out and when to get back in. Miss the best 10 days in the market over a 20-year period, and returns drop dramatically. According to research by Charles Schwab, missing just the 30 best days in the market from 1993-2013 turned a positive return into a negative return. The best days often occur during the worst times—right after crashes—when fear is highest and most people are selling.

The data is clear: time in the market beats timing the market. A study of investors from 1999-2018 showed that the average investor earned 1.9% annually, while the S&P 500 earned 5.6% annually. Why the difference? Emotional decisions—buying high when excited, selling low when scared. The solution is to invest systematically, ignore daily noise, and stay invested for the long term.

## Page 21 - Real Estate Investing Fundamentals

Real estate has created more millionaires than any other investment class. The advantages of real estate include: leverage (ability to control $500,000 property with $100,000 down payment), cash flow (monthly rental income), appreciation (property value increases over time), tax benefits (depreciation, mortgage interest deduction), and inflation hedge (rents increase with inflation).

The most common real estate investment strategy for building wealth is buying rental properties. The key metrics to evaluate rental properties are:

Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate): Net Operating Income ÷ Property Value. A cap rate of 8% or higher is generally considered good. This tells you the annual return if paying cash.

Cash-on-Cash Return: Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested. If someone puts $50,000 down and receives $5,000 in annual cash flow after all expenses, that's a 10% cash-on-cash return.

1% Rule: Monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price. A $200,000 property should rent for $2,000/month. This is a quick screening tool.

Debt Service Coverage Ratio: Net Operating Income ÷ Annual Debt Service. Lenders typically want to see 1.25 or higher, meaning income is 125% of mortgage payments.

## Page 22 - Real Estate Investment Strategy

The BRRRR strategy (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat) is a powerful method for building a real estate portfolio with limited capital. Here's how it works:

Buy: Purchase a distressed property below market value (often from foreclosure, estate sale, or motivated seller).

Rehab: Renovate the property to increase its value and make it rent-ready.

Rent: Place tenants and establish cash flow.

Refinance: Once property is renovated and rented, refinance at the new higher value and pull out most or all of the initial investment.

Repeat: Use the pulled-out capital to purchase the next property.

Example: Buy a distressed property for $150,000 with $30,000 down payment and $20,000 in renovations (total investment: $50,000). After renovation, property is worth $225,000. Refinance at 75% LTV = $168,750 loan, which pays off the original $120,000 loan and returns $48,750 of the initial $50,000 investment. Now own a cash-flowing rental property with only $1,250 of capital left in the deal, and can repeat the process.

## Page 23 - Tax Benefits of Real Estate

Real estate provides some of the best tax advantages available. The main benefits include:

Depreciation: The IRS allows real estate investors to depreciate residential rental property over 27.5 years. On a $300,000 property (excluding land value), that's about $10,909 in annual depreciation that offsets rental income—even though the property is likely appreciating in value.

Mortgage Interest Deduction: All interest paid on loans for rental properties is tax-deductible.

Operating Expense Deductions: Property taxes, insurance, maintenance, property management, utilities, HOA fees, travel to property, home office expenses—all deductible.

1031 Exchange: Allows investors to defer capital gains taxes indefinitely by selling a property and reinvesting proceeds into another "like-kind" property within specific timeframes.

Opportunity Zones: Invest capital gains into designated Opportunity Zones and defer taxes until 2026, with potential elimination of taxes on appreciation if held 10+ years.

Real Estate Professional Status: If qualifying as a real estate professional (750+ hours annually, more than any other occupation), can deduct unlimited rental losses against other income.

These tax benefits mean real estate investors often pay little to no income tax while building substantial wealth—completely legally.

## Page 24 - Precious Metals as Wealth Preservation

Gold and silver have been recognized as money for thousands of years. While they may not provide high returns like stocks or real estate, precious metals serve critical functions in a diversified portfolio: wealth preservation, inflation hedge, crisis insurance, and portfolio diversification.

Throughout history, gold has maintained purchasing power. One ounce of gold in 1920 ($20.67) could buy a quality men's suit. Today, one ounce of gold (~$1,800) can still buy a quality men's suit. Meanwhile, that same $20.67 in paper money can barely buy a decent shirt. This illustrates gold's role as a store of value and protection against currency debasement.

Financial advisors typically recommend holding 5-20% of a portfolio in precious metals. The strategy is not to "make money" from gold and silver but to preserve wealth. Think of it as insurance—you don't buy insurance hoping to profit from it; you buy it for protection when things go wrong.

Ways to invest in precious metals include:

Physical Bullion: Buy actual gold and silver coins or bars. Advantages: complete ownership, no counterparty risk. Disadvantages: storage, insurance, liquidity.

ETFs: GLD (gold) and SLV (silver) trade like stocks. Advantages: liquidity, no storage. Disadvantages: paper gold (don't own physical metal), counterparty risk.

Mining Stocks: Invest in companies that mine precious metals. Advantages: leverage to metal prices (miners' profits increase faster than metal prices). Disadvantages: company risk, operational risk.

For natural persons operating in trust, physical possession of gold and silver is recommended as these cannot be digitally confiscated and maintain value regardless of government or banking system stability.

## Page 25 - Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency represent a new asset class that's gained significant attention. While highly volatile and speculative, understanding digital assets is important as the world moves toward digital currencies and blockchain technology.

Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a decentralized digital currency—money that exists without government or central bank control. Like gold, there's a finite supply (21 million bitcoin maximum). Unlike gold, bitcoin is completely digital, easily divisible, and instantly transferable worldwide.

The case for bitcoin includes: inflation protection (fixed supply), digital gold (store of value), financial sovereignty (complete control), portfolio diversification (low correlation to stocks), and growing adoption (institutional investors, corporations, even countries).

The case against bitcoin includes: extreme volatility (50%+ drawdowns), regulatory uncertainty, no intrinsic value, environmental concerns (energy use), and technology risk.

For those who choose to invest in cryptocurrency, financial advisors typically recommend limiting exposure to 1-5% of portfolio due to high risk. Never invest more than willing to lose entirely. The strategy is dollar-cost averaging (buying small amounts regularly) rather than lump-sum investing.

## Page 26 - Banking for Natural Persons and Trusts

For natural persons operating through an Express Trust (explained fully in Chapter 8), banking requirements and strategies differ significantly from U.S. citizens. Express Trusts require specialized banking to maintain the separation between the public and private sides of commerce.

Traditional banks may not be ideal for trusts because they operate under U.S. corporate structure and federal banking regulations that attach obligations to account holders. Credit unions, particularly those chartered under state law rather than federal law, often provide better options for trust banking.

International banking and offshore accounts provide additional asset protection, privacy, and diversification. While Americans must report foreign accounts over $10,000 (FBAR requirement), international banking is completely legal and provides benefits including: asset protection from U.S. lawsuits and creditors, currency diversification, political risk diversification, and access to international investments.

Popular jurisdictions for international banking include Switzerland, Singapore, Cayman Islands, and Cook Islands. Each offers different levels of privacy, asset protection, and banking services. The key is ensuring all reporting requirements are met to avoid penalties while taking advantage of legal international banking benefits.

## Page 27 - Private Banking and Wealth Management

Private banking services are available to high-net-worth individuals (typically $1 million+ in liquid assets) and provide personalized financial services including dedicated relationship managers, customized investment strategies, estate planning, tax optimization, lending services, and concierge services.

Private banks differ from retail banks in several ways: higher minimum balances, personalized service, access to exclusive investment opportunities (private equity, hedge funds, IPO allocations), better lending terms (lower rates, higher loan-to-value ratios), and comprehensive wealth management.

The infinite banking concept (also called "becoming your own banker") uses whole life insurance policies as a personal banking system. The strategy involves: funding a properly structured whole life policy with high cash value, borrowing against the cash value for purchases instead of using bank loans, paying the loans back to yourself with interest, rinse and repeat while cash value continues growing.

Advantages include: tax-free growth, access to capital without qualification, ability to use money for anything, death benefit protection for family, asset protection (cash value is protected from creditors in most states). Disadvantages include: requires discipline to pay yourself back, takes time to build cash value, insurance costs reduce early returns.

## Page 28 - Building Generational Wealth

The ultimate goal of financial strategy should be building generational wealth—assets that provide for children, grandchildren, and future generations. This requires moving beyond personal consumption and embracing a mindset of stewardship and legacy building.

Key principles of generational wealth include:

Asset acquisition over consumption: Buy assets (stocks, real estate, businesses) that appreciate and generate income rather than liabilities (cars, boats, luxury items) that depreciate.

Multiple income streams: W-2 income, business income, rental income, dividend income, interest income, royalty income, capital gains. The wealthy don't rely on single income sources.

Education and financial literacy: Teach children about money, investing, entrepreneurship. Wealth literacy is as important as wealth itself.

Trust structures: Properly structured trusts protect assets from taxes, creditors, lawsuits, and ensure smooth transfer to future generations.

Tax optimization: Use all legal strategies to minimize taxes—retirement accounts, real estate depreciation, trust structures, charitable giving.

Estate planning: Wills, trusts, life insurance, beneficiary designations. Proper planning ensures assets transfer according to wishes and minimize estate taxes.

The wealthy think in generations, not quarters. They plant trees whose shade they'll never sit under. They build businesses and acquire assets that will serve their grandchildren. This long-term thinking fundamentally changes financial decisions and creates lasting family prosperity.

# Chapter 7 - Nationality

## Page 1 - Introduction to Nationality and Citizenship

The distinction between nationality and citizenship is one of the most misunderstood concepts in American law and society. Most Americans believe these terms are interchangeable, but they represent fundamentally different political and legal statuses with profound implications for rights, obligations, and relationship to government.

Nationality refers to one's membership in a nation—a group of people bound by common heritage, language, culture, and often ancestry. It is the natural, unalienable connection to one's people and land. Citizenship, on the other hand, is a artificial legal status created by government—a contract between individual and state that involves both rights and obligations, including the obligation of allegiance and obedience to government authority.

The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868, created a new class of citizenship that had not existed before. Section 1 states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

This language is carefully crafted. It creates two separate and distinct citizenships: United States citizenship and state citizenship. More importantly, it makes United States citizenship the primary status, with state citizenship being secondary and derivative. Before the Fourteenth Amendment, Americans were citizens of their states first and the United States second—a complete reversal of the current structure.

## Page 2 - The Meaning of "Subject to the Jurisdiction Thereof"

The phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the Fourteenth Amendment is crucial but rarely understood. It doesn't simply mean physically present in a location where laws apply. It means subject to the complete political jurisdiction—owing allegiance and obedience to the government.

During congressional debates on the Fourteenth Amendment, Senator Jacob Howard, who introduced the citizenship clause, explained: "This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers."

Senator Lyman Trumbull added: "The provision is, that 'all persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.' That means 'subject to the complete jurisdiction thereof.' What do we mean by 'complete jurisdiction thereof?' Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means."

This understanding was confirmed in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), where the Supreme Court explained that the Fourteenth Amendment created a "new citizenship" that was fundamentally different from the original state citizenship. The Court stated that there are two citizenships: one of the state and one of the United States, and that a citizen of the United States may or may not be a citizen of a state.

## Page 3 - Nationality vs. Citizenship Under International Law

International law recognizes the distinction between nationals and citizens. A national is a member of the nation by birth, blood, or naturalization. A citizen is someone who has been granted special privileges by government in exchange for obligations and duties.

The United States Code recognizes this distinction. Title 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(21) defines "national" as: "a person owing permanent allegiance to a state." Title 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(22) defines "national of the United States" as: "(A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States."

This reveals that nationality is the broader category, and citizenship is a specific subset. All U.S. citizens are U.S. nationals, but not all U.S. nationals are U.S. citizens. One can be a national without being a citizen—maintaining the natural connection to the nation without the artificial political obligations of citizenship.

The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 15, recognizes: "(1) Everyone has the right to a nationality. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality."

## Page 4 - State Nationals vs. Federal Citizens

The original structure of America recognized state nationals—people who were members of sovereign states that had joined together in a federation. The Constitution was ratified by state conventions, and allegiance was owed primarily to one's state. Federal citizenship barely existed; it was derivative of state citizenship.

The Fourteenth Amendment reversed this structure. It created a new class of federal citizens whose primary allegiance was to the United States government rather than to their state. This had the effect of nationalizing citizenship and reducing states to mere administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

Before 1868, free people born in the states were state nationals. They were "Citizens of the several states" under Article IV of the Constitution, which guarantees: "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States." This state citizenship was based on birth or naturalization within the state and was the primary political identity.

The Fourteenth Amendment citizenship, on the other hand, applies to those "born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." This creates a citizenship based on territorial presence and political subjection rather than membership in a sovereign state. It is a fundamentally different status with different legal implications.

## Page 5 - The Political Status of Natural Persons

A natural person, in law, is a human being as distinguished from an artificial person such as a corporation or legal entity. However, the term has deeper meaning in the context of American constitutionalism. A natural person is one who exists in a state of nature—possessing natural, inherent, unalienable rights that precede government and cannot be legitimately taken away by government.

The Declaration of Independence recognizes this status: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

These rights don't come from government; they exist naturally and can only be secured (not granted) by government. Natural persons are those who assert and maintain these natural rights rather than accepting privileges granted by government in place of rights.

The distinction between rights and privileges is fundamental. A right is something inherent that exists without government permission. A privilege is something granted by government that can be regulated, licensed, or taken away. Fourteenth Amendment citizenship converted rights into privileges by making them dependent on government recognition and protection.

## Page 6 - The Legal Definition of "Citizen of the United States"

The term "citizen of the United States" has specific legal meaning that differs from common understanding. In legal dictionaries and court cases, this term has been carefully defined:

Ballentine's Law Dictionary defines "citizen of the United States" as: "One who owes allegiance to the United States and who is entitled to protection by it."

Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition, defines "citizen of the United States" as: "Citizens are members of a political community who, in their associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a government for the promotion of their general welfare and the protection of their individual as well as their collective rights."

Note the key words: "submitted themselves to the dominion of a government." This is a voluntary act of submission and allegiance. It creates a master-servant relationship where the citizen owes obedience to government in exchange for protection.

The Supreme Court in Minor v. Happersett (1874) explained: "The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that. At common-law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners."

## Page 7 - Expatriation and Change of Political Status

The right to expatriate—to change one's citizenship or nationality—is recognized in both U.S. and international law. The Expatriation Act of 1868 declares: "the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Title 8 U.S.C. § 1481 lists acts by which a U.S. citizen loses citizenship, including: obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign state, serving in foreign armed forces, accepting employment with a foreign government, and formally renouncing United States nationality.

The key provision is (a)(6): "making a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state."

However, there's another method not widely known: changing one's political status from federal U.S. citizen to state national. This doesn't involve renouncing American nationality—it involves reclaiming the original status that existed before the Fourteenth Amendment. It means asserting status as a national of a state (e.g., California, Texas, Virginia) rather than as a citizen of the federal United States.

## Page 8 - State National Declaration Process

Reclaiming status as a state national involves several legal steps to create a clear public record of political status:

First, prepare a Declaration of Political Status that clearly states: removal from Fourteenth Amendment citizenship, reclamation of state national status, reservation of all natural rights, and rejection of federal benefits and privileges that create obligations.

Second, record this declaration with the county recorder in the county of domicile. This creates a public record that can be used as evidence of political status.

Third, send notice to relevant federal agencies including the State Department, Social Security Administration, and Internal Revenue Service, informing them of the change in political status.

Fourth, obtain necessary documents including a state-issued ID (not federal Real ID), certified copies of the recorded declaration, and possibly a new passport showing national status rather than citizen status.

Fifth, act consistently with the new status. This means not accepting federal benefits, not registering to vote in federal elections (state elections may still be available), not seeking federal employment or contracts, and operating in commerce as a natural person rather than as a federal citizen.

The key is understanding that this is not about hiding from government or avoiding all obligations. It's about choosing which political status to operate under and maintaining consistency with that choice.

## Page 9 - The Moors and Moorish Nationality

The Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Noble Drew Ali in 1913, teaches that so-called "Black," "Negro," "Colored," or "African American" people in America are actually Moors—descendants of the ancient Moabites and members of the Moorish Nation.

According to Moorish teachings, Moors are the aboriginal people of North America and have a nationality that precedes and supersedes any citizenship imposed by the United States government. The Moorish Science Temple issues Nationality Cards identifying members as "Moorish Americans" claiming aboriginal and indigenous status.

This understanding is based on several historical and legal arguments:

The Moors ruled Spain for over 700 years and had extensive influence throughout Europe and Africa. Some Moorish teachers claim this heritage extends to the Americas through ancient migrations.

The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Morocco and the United States (1787) is cited as recognizing Moorish nationality and providing special status.

The Dred Scott decision (1857), while denying citizenship to enslaved Africans, stated they were "beings of an inferior order" who could never become citizens. Moorish nationals argue this proves their ancestors were never intended to be U.S. citizens and that the Fourteenth Amendment was actually a trick to impose citizenship on free Moors.

The Moorish movement has faced significant legal challenges, with courts generally rejecting claims that Moorish nationality provides exemption from U.S. law. However, the underlying concept—that nationality is separate from citizenship and can be asserted based on heritage and self-identification—raises important questions about political identity and self-determination.

## Page 10 - Indigenous Nations and Tribal Citizenship

Native American tribal members have a unique status under U.S. law. They are citizens of their tribal nations first, and may also be U.S. citizens, but these are separate and distinct statuses.

The Constitution recognizes Indian tribes as distinct political entities in Article I, Section 8, giving Congress power "To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." This places tribes in a category with foreign nations—separate sovereigns.

Worcester v. Georgia (1832) established that Indian nations are "distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive" and that state law has no force within tribal territory.

The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born within the territorial limits of the United States, but did not terminate their tribal citizenship. Native Americans thus have dual citizenship: tribal and federal.

Tribal citizenship is determined by each tribe according to its own criteria, typically involving blood quantum (percentage of ancestry from that tribe) and enrollment procedures. Tribal members receive certain benefits and protections but are also subject to tribal jurisdiction and law.

This dual citizenship model shows that multiple political statuses can coexist—one can be a citizen of a tribal nation while also being a U.S. national or citizen. The key is understanding which jurisdiction applies in which context and acting consistently with the chosen primary status.

## Page 11 - Domicile vs. Residence

Understanding the difference between domicile and residence is crucial for determining legal status and jurisdiction. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct legal meanings with significant consequences.

Residence is simply the place where one physically lives. A person can have multiple residences—a primary home, vacation home, and rental properties. Residence is a question of fact determined by physical presence.

Domicile, however, is the place one considers their permanent home with the intent to return whenever away. It is a question of both fact and intent. A person can have only one domicile at a time, and domicile determines which jurisdiction's laws apply for taxation, voting, probate, and many other legal matters.

The key distinction is intent. One can be temporarily residing in a location without being domiciled there. For example, a student attending university in another state is a resident of that state but remains domiciled in their home state if they intend to return there after graduation.

Black's Law Dictionary defines domicile as: "That place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning."

For purposes of changing political status from U.S. citizen to state national, establishing domicile in a state (rather than the federal United States) is essential. This involves demonstrating both physical presence in the state and intent to make it a permanent home.

## Page 12 - The District of Columbia and Federal Territories

The United States consists of two separate and distinct jurisdictions: the federal zone (District of Columbia and federal territories) and the 50 states. Understanding this distinction is crucial for asserting proper nationality status.

Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution grants Congress power "To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States."

This created a federal zone where Congress has complete legislative authority—essentially acting as a city council for Washington D.C. This is very different from Congress's limited powers within the states, where it can only legislate on matters specifically delegated by the Constitution.

Federal territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands) similarly fall under complete congressional authority. Residents of these territories are U.S. nationals but not necessarily U.S. citizens with full constitutional rights.

The legal argument made by many state nationals is that federal legislation passed under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 authority only applies within the federal zone and territories, not within the 50 states. Therefore, many federal statutes regarding taxation, regulation, and administrative procedures only apply to those domiciled in the federal zone or operating as federal citizens.

This is why domicile becomes crucial. By establishing domicile in a state and asserting state national status, one places themselves outside the federal zone jurisdiction and under the protection of state law and the Constitution's original structure.

## Page 13 - The Strawman Theory and Legal Fiction

One controversial theory in the sovereignty movement is the "strawman" or "legal fiction" concept. This theory holds that when a birth certificate is issued, it creates a legal entity—a corporation or trust—that is separate from the living, breathing human being.

According to this theory, the all-capital-letters name on legal documents (JOHN DOE) represents the legal fiction, while the proper name (John Doe) represents the natural person. Government and corporations interact with the legal fiction, not the natural person, and most people unknowingly assume liability for the legal fiction by responding to that name.

The strawman theory suggests that when someone receives mail addressed to their all-capital name, they are receiving correspondence meant for the legal fiction. By accepting and responding, they are assuming the role of trustee or agent for that legal fiction and accepting all associated liabilities.

Critics dismiss this theory as pseudolaw with no basis in actual legal doctrine. Courts have consistently rejected strawman arguments, and attempting to use them in legal proceedings often results in penalties for frivolous litigation.

However, defenders of the theory point to the Uniform Commercial Code's definitions and procedures around secured parties and debtors, suggesting that understanding one's role in commerce can change legal relationships. They also note that corporations and legal fictions do play major roles in modern law, and understanding the distinction between natural persons and legal entities has merit, even if the specific strawman mechanics are disputed.

## Page 14 - The Social Security Number and Federal Jurisdiction

The Social Security Number (SSN) is often cited as the mechanism by which people are brought under federal jurisdiction and citizenship. Understanding its true nature and how to interact with it is important for those asserting state national status.

The Social Security Act of 1935 created a social insurance program for workers. Initially, participation was limited to certain employment categories and was nominally voluntary. Over time, it has been expanded to cover nearly all employment and has become practically mandatory for accessing banking, credit, employment, and government services.

The SSN functions as a federal identification number that connects an individual to the Social Security Administration and, by extension, to federal jurisdiction. When someone applies for and uses an SSN, they are arguably entering into a contract with the federal government and accepting the obligations and benefits of the Social Security system.

Title 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(B)(i) states that Social Security account numbers are for the "programs of the Social Security Administration" and are not for use as general identification. However, the Privacy Act of 1974 and subsequent legislation have allowed widespread use of SSNs for identification purposes.

State nationals who wish to completely separate from federal jurisdiction face the challenge of how to function in modern society without an SSN. Some options include: using an alternative tax identification number (such as an EIN for a business entity), refusing to provide SSN where legally permissible, or seeking to "retire" the SSN through formal notice to the Social Security Administration.

The key issue is that accepting and using federal benefits (Social Security, Medicare, federal employment, etc.) is generally incompatible with asserting freedom from federal obligations and jurisdiction.

## Page 15 - Passports and Travel Documents for Nationals

U.S. nationals who are not U.S. citizens have the right to obtain special passports that reflect their status. Title 22 U.S.C. § 2705 and State Department regulations recognize two types of passports: citizen passports and national passports.

A standard U.S. passport contains the language "The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance."

The key word is "requests"—this is a request for safe passage, not a demand. The passport facilitates travel but also serves as evidence of political status and jurisdiction.

For those who have changed their status from U.S. citizen to state national (non-citizen national), it's possible to obtain a passport that reflects this status. The passport application process allows for designation as "Non-citizen National of the United States" based on 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(22)(B).

However, obtaining such a passport requires providing evidence of non-citizen national status, which typically means documenting birth in an American territory (such as American Samoa) or completing the expatriation process. Simply declaring state national status without proper documentation will not result in a non-citizen national passport.

Some state nationals choose not to obtain any passport, arguing that the right to travel is inherent and doesn't require government permission. However, as a practical matter, international travel without a passport is nearly impossible, and domestic travel can be hindered without proper identification.

## Page 16 - Voting Rights and Political Participation

The question of voting rights for state nationals is complex. The Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments protect voting rights from discrimination based on race, sex, poll taxes, and age. However, these amendments apply to "citizens of the United States."

State nationals who have expatriated from U.S. citizenship technically lose the right to vote in federal elections. However, they may retain the right to vote in state elections depending on state law, as state citizenship can exist independently of federal citizenship.

The reality is that voting in modern elections requires registration, which typically involves declaring U.S. citizenship and providing an SSN. State nationals who wish to avoid federal jurisdiction often choose not to register to vote or participate in federal elections.

This raises philosophical questions about political participation and representation. If one is not a U.S. citizen and doesn't vote, how does one have influence over government? The answer typically given is that natural persons influence government through different means: commercial activity, public education, private contracts, and asserting rights rather than seeking privileges.

Some argue that voting is actually consent to be governed—by participating in the election, one accepts the outcome and the authority of the winner. Therefore, not voting is a way of withholding consent and maintaining sovereignty.

Others maintain that voting is a duty and the primary means by which people can influence government policy. Giving up the vote is giving up the most direct form of political power.

## Page 17 - Jury Service and Court Participation

Federal court jury service is typically limited to U.S. citizens. Title 28 U.S.C. § 1865(b)(1) requires that federal jurors be "citizens of the United States." State nationals who are not U.S. citizens would therefore be excluded from federal jury service.

State jury service requirements vary by state. Some states require U.S. citizenship, while others only require state residency or citizenship of the state. State nationals would need to check their specific state requirements.

Regarding court participation more generally, state nationals face unique challenges. While they have the right to access courts for redress of grievances, they may encounter resistance from judges and court personnel who are unfamiliar with the distinction between nationals and citizens.

The key is proper preparation and documentation. When appearing in court, state nationals should: bring certified copies of their declaration of political status, provide proper notice of status to the court before appearance, object to any presumption of U.S. citizenship jurisdiction, and assert rights as a natural person rather than requesting privileges as a citizen.

Common Law Courts vs. Statutory/Admiralty Courts is another issue raised in the sovereignty movement. Some argue that modern courts have abandoned common law in favor of statutory, admiralty, or equity jurisdiction that doesn't protect natural rights. Whether or not this theory is correct, understanding the type of law being applied and the rights one can assert is important for effective court participation.

## Page 18 - Taxation and the State National

Perhaps no issue is more controversial in the state national movement than taxation. The argument goes: if one is not a federal U.S. citizen and has no domicile in the federal zone, then federal income tax should not apply.

This argument is based on several premises: the Sixteenth Amendment authorizes taxation of "incomes" but doesn't define what income means; the Internal Revenue Code defines "United States" as federal territories and possessions, not the 50 states; income tax is an indirect excise tax on privileged activities, not a direct tax on all earnings; and state nationals who don't engage in federally privileged activities should have no tax liability.

The counterarguments are equally strong: the Sixteenth Amendment clearly states "from whatever source derived," indicating all income is taxable; Supreme Court cases (Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, etc.) have upheld income tax as constitutional; Title 26 defines "citizen" and "resident" broadly enough to include most people; and practically speaking, the IRS considers all persons earning income in the United States to be liable for income tax unless specifically exempted.

Courts have consistently ruled against tax protesters who argue they're not subject to income tax based on citizenship status. Many people have faced criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment for refusing to file or pay taxes based on these theories.

However, there are legal ways to reduce or eliminate tax liability: establishing domicile in a state with no income tax, organizing business activities through entities with favorable tax treatment, maximizing deductions and credits, using retirement accounts and tax-advantaged structures, and engaging in tax planning with qualified professionals.

## Page 19 - Commercial Affidavits and Private Contracts

Many in the state national movement use commercial affidavits to establish facts and create enforceable commercial liens. The theory is that under the Uniform Commercial Code, an unrebutted affidavit becomes truth in commerce and can be used to establish rights, settle accounts, or create obligations.

A commercial affidavit typically includes: statement of facts being affirmed, declaration that the affidavit is true, correct, and complete, offer for the recipient to rebut any statements, and notice that failure to rebut within specified time constitutes agreement and estoppel.

These affidavits are often sent to government officials, banks, or other parties with notice that silence equals acceptance. If no rebuttal is received, the affidavit maker claims the facts are established and can be used as evidence or basis for further action.

Critics argue this is an abuse of UCC provisions that were meant for commercial transactions between businesses, not for challenging government authority or establishing political status. Courts have generally been unreceptive to commercial affidavits used this way.

Nevertheless, the underlying principle—that affidavits are evidence and unrebutted facts stand—has some validity. The question is whether commercial law principles can be applied to political and governmental relationships, or whether they're limited to private commercial transactions.

Private contracts are another tool used by state nationals. The idea is to create private agreements that govern relationships and transactions outside of statutory law. For example, creating private membership associations for business, using private contracts for employment relationships, or establishing private trusts to hold assets.

## Page 20 - The Fourteenth Amendment as Contract

A more sophisticated legal argument views the Fourteenth Amendment not as a straightforward grant of citizenship, but as an offer of a contract. Under this view, citizenship is a voluntary status that comes with both benefits (protection, privileges) and obligations (taxes, obedience, service).

The contract theory holds that by accepting benefits of U.S. citizenship—Social Security, Medicare, federal employment, federal student loans, etc.—one accepts the contract and all its obligations. However, one can choose to reject the contract by refusing the benefits and giving notice of rejection.

This is different from simply asserting that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply. Instead, it's acknowledging that the Amendment created a valid offer, but that one can choose to accept or reject that offer. Acceptance is shown by conduct—using SSN, taking federal benefits, registering to vote in federal elections. Rejection must also be shown by conduct—giving up these benefits and behaviors.

Contract law requires: offer, acceptance, and consideration. The Fourteenth Amendment provided the offer (citizenship with associated benefits). Acceptance occurs through conduct and use of the SSN. Consideration is the mutual exchange of benefits for obligations.

To rescind a contract requires: notice of rescission, return of benefits received, and cessation of conduct showing acceptance. This is why state nationals must not only declare their status but also actively reject federal benefits and identification.

Whether courts would actually recognize Fourteenth Amendment citizenship as a voluntary contract subject to recission is doubtful. Most legal scholars view it as a status imposed by law, not a contract subject to individual choice. However, the contract analysis provides a framework for understanding the relationship and the steps needed to change it.

## Page 21 - Foreign Status and Diplomatic Immunity

Some individuals claim status as foreign nationals or ambassadors to exempt themselves from U.S. law. These claims typically involve asserting membership in organizations like the "Washitaw Nation," "Kingdom of Heaven," or other self-proclaimed sovereign entities.

The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) provides immunity for diplomatic agents of foreign states. However, this immunity is based on reciprocity between recognized nations and doesn't extend to individuals who simply declare themselves diplomats.

Title 22 U.S.C. § 254 governs diplomatic immunity in the United States and requires proper credentials issued by a recognized foreign government. Self-declared status is not sufficient.

Courts have consistently rejected claims of diplomatic immunity based on membership in unrecognized organizations or self-declared sovereign status. Such claims often result in harsher treatment as courts view them as frivolous attempts to avoid legal obligations.

However, the underlying concept—that one's political status determines which laws apply—has validity. Genuine foreign nationals do have different legal status than U.S. citizens. The question is how one establishes legitimate foreign national status.

For those with actual dual citizenship (born abroad to foreign parents, or naturalized as a citizen of another country), foreign national status is real and can be documented. Such individuals may be able to use that status to reduce or eliminate certain U.S. obligations, particularly if they reside abroad.

## Page 22 - The Mechanics of Status Correction

For those serious about changing political status from U.S. citizen to state national, a systematic approach is necessary. This is not a single document or declaration, but an ongoing process of aligning all aspects of life with the chosen status.

Step 1: Study and Understanding. Before taking any action, thoroughly research the legal and practical implications. This includes studying the Constitution, relevant court cases, statutory definitions, and historical context. Consult with knowledgeable advisors (though finding attorneys who support this approach is difficult).

Step 2: Declaration Preparation. Draft a comprehensive declaration of political status that clearly states: current status (U.S. citizen), desired status (state national), legal basis for the change, resignation from all federal privileges and benefits, and reservation of all natural rights. This should be properly notarized and documented.

Step 3: Recording and Notice. Record the declaration with the county recorder. Send copies to relevant agencies (Social Security Administration, State Department, IRS) along with notices of status change. Keep certified copies of all documents.

Step 4: Lifestyle Alignment. This is the most challenging part. It requires: closing or restructuring bank accounts that use SSN, terminating Social Security participation, possibly obtaining new identification, restructuring business and employment relationships, changing approach to taxes and government interactions, and consistent behavior reflecting the new status.

Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance. Continue to act consistently with state national status. Don't slip back into accepting federal benefits or acting as a U.S. citizen. Maintain documentation. Update records as needed.

The reality is that this process is complex, carries significant risks, and may not provide the benefits hoped for. Courts have not been receptive to these arguments, and individuals who pursue this path often face increased scrutiny and legal challenges.

## Page 23 - Practical Considerations and Risks

Anyone considering changing their political status must carefully weigh the practical implications and risks:

Banking and Finance: Most banks require SSN for accounts. Operating without SSN severely limits banking options. Credit becomes difficult or impossible to obtain. Mortgage, auto loans, and other financing may be unavailable.

Employment: Most employers require SSN for tax reporting. Self-employment or private contracts may be necessary. Income reporting and taxation become complicated.

Government Services: No Social Security benefits, Medicare, federal student loans, federal employment, or other federal programs. State services may or may not be affected depending on state laws.

Legal Risks: Tax authorities may view refusal to file or pay as criminal tax evasion. Courts have imposed significant fines and prison sentences on tax protesters. Legal expenses for defending one's position can be substantial.

Family Impact: Spouses and children may be affected by one's status choice. Inheritance and estate planning become more complex. Access to education and employment opportunities may be limited.

Social Challenges: Family and friends may not understand or support the decision. Explaining one's status in daily interactions can be awkward. Many people will view status claims as eccentric or problematic.

For most people, these costs outweigh any potential benefits. The decision to pursue state national status should not be made lightly or based on appeals to avoid taxes or legal obligations. It should be based on genuine philosophical commitment and with full understanding of the consequences.

## Page 24 - Alternative Approaches to Sovereignty

Rather than formally changing political status, there are other ways to increase personal autonomy and reduce dependence on government:

Financial Independence: Build wealth and passive income streams to reduce dependence on government programs. Develop multiple income sources that don't rely on traditional employment.

Privacy Protection: Minimize sharing of personal information. Use privacy-protecting technologies and practices. Understand and assert Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches.

Asset Protection: Use legal structures (trusts, LLCs, etc.) to protect assets. Understand exempt assets under state law. Consider international diversification for some assets.

Self-Sufficiency: Develop skills and resources for independence. Food production, water systems, energy independence. Community building with like-minded individuals.

Legal Knowledge: Understand rights and how to assert them. Learn proper court procedures. Know when to stand firm and when to compromise.

Political Engagement: Work to change laws and policies through legitimate political processes. Support candidates and movements aligned with constitutional principles. Educate others about rights and government limitations.

These approaches can increase practical freedom and autonomy without the legal risks and complications of formally challenging citizenship status. For many, this middle path provides the best balance of principles and pragmatism.

# Chapter 8 - The Temple & Trust

## Page 1 - Introduction to Express Trusts

The Express Trust is perhaps the most powerful legal tool available to natural persons for protecting assets, maintaining privacy, and operating in commerce as a private entity separate from the public person. Understanding and properly implementing an Express Trust can fundamentally change one's relationship with government, creditors, and the financial system.

A trust is a legal relationship in which one party (the trustor or grantor) transfers property to another party (the trustee) to hold and manage for the benefit of third parties (the beneficiaries). Trusts have existed for centuries and are recognized in all common law jurisdictions.

There are many types of trusts: revocable and irrevocable, living and testamentary, simple and complex. The Express Trust is a specific type of trust that is created intentionally through a written declaration rather than implied by law or equity.

The key characteristics of an Express Trust are: it is created by explicit written declaration, it clearly identifies the trustor, trustee, and beneficiaries, it specifies the trust property (corpus), and it states the terms and conditions governing the trust's operation.

An Express Trust differs from a statutory trust (created under state trust statutes) in that it exists under common law and does not require registration with the state or government approval. It is a private contract among the parties that is protected by the contract clause of the Constitution.

## Page 2 - The Constitutional Protection of Trusts

Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution states: "No State shall... pass any... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts." This is known as the Contract Clause, and it provides powerful protection for private agreements including trusts.

The Supreme Court established in Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819) that corporate charters are contracts protected by this clause. By extension, private trust agreements are similarly protected. Once a trust is validly created, neither state nor federal government can impair its obligations or force changes to its terms.

This constitutional protection is why Express Trusts are so valuable. Unlike corporations or LLCs, which are created by state statute and can be altered by subsequent legislation, common law Express Trusts exist independent of statute and are protected against government interference.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed trust protections. In Helvering v. Clifford (1940), the Court recognized that trusts are separate entities from their grantors for tax purposes. In Williams v. Dorset (2004), the Court upheld creditor protection for properly structured trusts.

The key is that the trust must be genuine—not a sham created solely for tax avoidance or fraud. It must have legitimate purposes, actual separation of control, and real economic substance. When these criteria are met, the trust receives full constitutional protection.

## Page 3 - The Three Roles in Trust: Trustor, Trustee, Beneficiary

Understanding the three roles in a trust is essential for proper operation:

The Trustor (also called Grantor, Settlor, or Creator) is the person who creates the trust and transfers property into it. The trustor establishes the terms of the trust and decides who will serve as trustee and who will benefit from the trust. Once property is transferred into the trust, the trustor generally gives up ownership and control (particularly in an irrevocable trust).

The Trustee is the person or entity who holds legal title to the trust property and manages it according to the trust terms. The trustee has fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries—meaning they must act in the beneficiaries' best interest, not their own. Trustees can be individuals or entities (banks, trust companies, or even corporations). The trustee has power but not beneficial enjoyment of the trust property.

The Beneficiaries are the persons or entities who benefit from the trust. They hold equitable title—the right to receive benefits from the trust property. Beneficiaries can be current (receiving benefits now) or remainder (receiving benefits in the future). They have the right to enforce the trust terms and hold the trustee accountable.

In many Express Trusts used for asset protection, the same person may serve in multiple roles at different times, but proper separation must be maintained. For example, the trustor might initially serve as trustee, but the trust terms should allow for succession or replacement of the trustee to show genuine separation.

## Page 4 - The Trust as a Separate Entity

Once properly created, a trust becomes a separate legal entity—distinct from the trustor, trustee, and beneficiaries. This separation is crucial for asset protection, tax treatment, and privacy.

The trust owns the trust property. The trustor no longer owns it. The trustee holds legal title but doesn't own it beneficially. The beneficiaries have rights to benefits but don't own the property either. This three-way division of interests is what creates the protective shield.

Because the trust is a separate entity, creditors of the trustor generally cannot reach trust assets. If someone sues the trustor personally and obtains a judgment, they can only collect from the trustor's personal assets, not trust assets. Similarly, creditors of the trustee cannot reach trust assets (unless the claim relates to trust business). And creditors of beneficiaries can only reach the beneficiary's interest in distributions, not the underlying trust property.

This makes Express Trusts extremely valuable for asset protection. By transferring assets into a properly structured trust, one can shield them from lawsuits, creditors, divorce settlements, and even government seizure (with some exceptions for criminal activity and certain tax claims).

The trust also has its own tax identity. An Express Trust files its own tax return (Form 1041) and pays taxes on undistributed income. Distributed income is taxed to the beneficiaries. This allows for tax planning and potential savings through income splitting and timing of distributions.

## Page 5 - Irrevocable vs. Revocable Trusts

Express Trusts can be either revocable or irrevocable, with significant differences in protection and taxation:

Revocable Trusts (also called Living Trusts) allow the trustor to modify or terminate the trust at any time. The trustor typically serves as trustee and retains complete control. Upon the trustor's death, the trust becomes irrevocable and distributes assets according to the trust terms, avoiding probate.

Revocable trusts provide probate avoidance, privacy, and ease of asset management, but offer no asset protection during the trustor's life. Since the trustor can revoke the trust and take back the assets, creditors can force them to do so. For tax purposes, revocable trusts are ignored—all trust income is taxed to the trustor.

Irrevocable Trusts cannot be modified or terminated by the trustor once created (or only with extreme difficulty and court approval). The trustor gives up control and cannot serve as trustee. Assets are permanently transferred out of the trustor's estate.

Irrevocable trusts provide strong asset protection because the trustor no longer owns or controls the assets and cannot get them back to satisfy creditors. They also provide estate tax benefits—trust assets are not included in the trustor's taxable estate. For tax purposes, irrevocable trusts are separate entities that pay their own taxes on undistributed income.

The Express Trust structure typically used by state nationals is an irrevocable trust to maximize asset protection and privacy. The trade-off is loss of direct control, which is why the trustee selection and trust terms must be carefully considered.

## Page 6 - Creating an Express Trust Declaration

The foundation of an Express Trust is the Declaration of Trust—the written document that creates the trust and establishes its terms. This declaration must be properly drafted to ensure validity and achieve the desired purposes.

Essential elements of a valid trust declaration include:

Declaration of Intent: Clear statement that the trustor is creating a trust. "The Trustor hereby declares and establishes this Express Trust..."

Trust Name: The trust must have a name that identifies it. Often uses the trustor's name plus "Express Trust," e.g., "HEINZ WOLFGANG EXPRESS TRUST."

Parties: Full legal names and roles of the trustor, initial trustee, and beneficiaries.

Trust Property: Description of property being transferred into the trust (the corpus or principal). Can be specific property or "all property now owned or hereafter acquired."

Trust Purpose: Statement of the trust's purposes. Common purposes include asset protection, estate planning, family provision, charitable goals, and privacy.

Trustee Powers: Detailed list of what the trustee is authorized to do—buy and sell property, enter contracts, manage investments, distribute income, etc.

Beneficiary Rights: What benefits beneficiaries are entitled to and when. Can specify distribution standards, timing, and conditions.

Duration: How long the trust will last. Can be for a term of years, until certain events, or in perpetuity (subject to rule against perpetuities).

## Page 7 - Trust Property and Funding

Creating the trust declaration is only the first step. The trust must also be funded—property must actually be transferred into the trust. Without property, a trust is empty and provides no benefits.

Property that can be held in trust includes: real estate (transfer by deed), financial accounts (retitle into trust name), vehicles (retitle registration), business interests (assign ownership to trust), intellectual property (assign rights to trust), personal property (bill of sale to trust), and future acquired property (trust terms can include "after-acquired property" clause).

The transfer must be legally effective. For real property, a deed must be executed and recorded. For titled property like vehicles, registration must be changed. For accounts, the institution must retitle the account. For other property, a bill of sale or assignment is used.

Once property is transferred to the trust, the trustee holds legal title in the name of the trust. For example, real estate might be titled "HEINZ WOLFGANG EXPRESS TRUST, Heinz Wolfgang, Trustee." This shows the trust owns the property and Heinz Wolfgang holds it in his capacity as trustee, not personally.

Proper documentation is crucial. Keep copies of all deeds, assignments, bills of sale, and retitling documents. Create a schedule of trust assets that is updated as property is added or removed. This documentation proves the trust owns the property and protects against challenges.

## Page 8 - Selecting Trustees and Successor Trustees

The trustee is the most important person in trust operation. Selecting the right trustee and establishing proper succession is critical.

Factors to consider in selecting a trustee include: trustworthiness (will they act in the beneficiaries' interest?), competence (do they have the skills to manage the trust property?), availability (will they have time to perform trustee duties?), independence (are they sufficiently independent from the beneficiaries?), and longevity (will they be able to serve for the trust's duration?).

For many Express Trusts, the trustor initially serves as trustee. This provides continuity and control during the transition period. However, for maximum asset protection, the trustor should not remain as trustee long-term because courts may collapse the trust as a sham if the trustor retains too much control.

The trust should name one or more successor trustees who will take over when the initial trustee resigns, becomes incapacitated, or dies. Succession can be automatic (named in the trust) or by appointment (trustee or beneficiaries select the successor).

Professional trustees (banks, trust companies, attorneys) provide expertise and continuity but charge fees. Family members provide continuity and understanding but may lack expertise or create conflicts. Corporate trustees (your own corporation or LLC serving as trustee) provide flexibility but require proper structure.

The key is having a clear succession plan so the trust continues operating smoothly regardless of what happens to any individual trustee.

## Page 9 - Trustee Duties and Fiduciary Responsibilities

Trustees have significant legal duties imposed by both the trust terms and general fiduciary law. Understanding these duties is essential for anyone serving as trustee.

The primary duties include:

Duty of Loyalty: Act solely in the beneficiaries' interest, not the trustee's personal interest. Avoid self-dealing and conflicts of interest. Don't profit from the trusteeship beyond reasonable compensation.

Duty of Prudence: Manage trust property as a prudent person would. Make reasonable investments. Avoid unnecessary risks. Diversify holdings. Maintain adequate insurance.

Duty to Preserve Trust Property: Protect and maintain trust assets. Don't waste or unnecessarily deplete the corpus. Balance current beneficiaries' needs with remainder beneficiaries' interests.

Duty to Make Trust Productive: Invest idle funds. Don't let cash sit unproductively. Generate reasonable income for current beneficiaries.

Duty of Impartiality: Treat all beneficiaries fairly. Don't favor one over another unless the trust terms explicitly allow it.

Duty to Account: Keep accurate records of all trust transactions. Provide regular accounting to beneficiaries. Allow beneficiaries to examine trust records.

Duty to Inform: Keep beneficiaries reasonably informed about trust administration. Notify them of significant developments. Respond to reasonable requests for information.

Duty to Follow Trust Terms: Administer the trust according to its written terms. Don't deviate from the trustor's instructions.

Breach of these duties can result in personal liability for the trustee. Beneficiaries can sue for damages, removal of the trustee, and even criminal charges in cases of fraud or embezzlement. This is why trustees should document decisions, maintain insurance, and consult professionals when needed.

## Page 10 - Trust Taxation and IRS Reporting

Trusts have their own tax rules that differ from individuals and corporations. Understanding trust taxation is crucial for compliance and planning.

Express Trusts use their own tax ID number (Employer Identification Number or EIN) rather than the trustor's Social Security Number. This separation is important for privacy and protection.

Trusts file Form 1041 (U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts) annually. This return reports the trust's income, deductions, and distributions.

Trusts are allowed a small exemption ($300 for complex trusts, $100 for simple trusts) and then pay tax on undistributed income at compressed tax rates that reach the highest bracket quickly. For 2021, trusts reach the 37% bracket at only $13,050 of taxable income.

However, income distributed to beneficiaries is taxed to them, not to the trust. The trust takes a distribution deduction, and beneficiaries report the income on their personal returns (receiving Schedule K-1 from the trust).

This creates tax planning opportunities. If beneficiaries are in lower tax brackets than the trust would be, distributions reduce overall tax. If beneficiaries are in higher brackets, accumulating income in the trust might save tax.

Trusts must also file information returns for reportable transactions, foreign accounts, and other activities just like individuals. The trustee is responsible for all tax compliance.

For state nationals who have changed their status, trust taxation can be complex. The trust itself is a domestic trust if it meets the control and court tests under IRC §7701(a)(30). If operated properly, it should file and pay taxes like any other domestic trust, regardless of the trustor's or beneficiaries' citizenship status.

## Page 11 - Pure Trusts and Constitutional Trusts

Within the sovereignty and state national movements, there are specific trust structures called "Pure Trusts" or "Constitutional Trusts" that claim special benefits beyond standard Express Trusts.

Pure Trust organizations claim these trusts are: based on common law rather than statute, not subject to state or federal regulation, exempt from taxation, providing absolute asset protection, and allowing trustor to maintain control while having protection.

The theory is that Pure Trusts existed before statutory law and are protected by the Constitution's contract clause, therefore government cannot regulate or tax them. Promoters sell Pure Trust packages claiming they're the ultimate asset protection and tax avoidance tool.

The reality, according to the IRS and courts, is very different. The IRS has specifically targeted Pure Trusts and similar structures as abusive tax shelters. IRS Notice 97-24 warns that "certain trust arrangements" claiming to eliminate taxes while allowing control are shams.

Courts have consistently ruled that Pure Trusts are taxable based on their substance, not their form. If the trustor retains control and beneficial enjoyment, the trust is ignored for tax purposes, and all income is taxed to the trustor. This is called the "grantor trust" rules under IRC §§671-679.

Additionally, using Pure Trusts for tax avoidance can result in substantial penalties: accuracy-related penalties (20%), civil fraud penalties (75%), criminal prosecution for tax evasion, and promoter penalties for those selling the structures.

The lesson is that while Express Trusts are legitimate and valuable, exaggerated claims about "magic" trust structures that eliminate all taxes and regulation should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

## Page 12 - Asset Protection Trust Strategies

When properly structured, Express Trusts provide significant asset protection. However, the protection is not absolute, and certain rules must be followed.

Key principles of asset protection trusts:

The trust must be irrevocable. If the trustor can revoke and reclaim assets, so can the trustor's creditors.

The trustor cannot be the sole beneficiary. There must be other beneficiaries with real interests.

The trustor should not serve as trustee, or if they do, should have limited powers and a co-trustee or successor ready.

The trust must have legitimate purposes beyond asset protection. Estate planning, family provision, and business purposes all work.

Transfers into the trust must not be fraudulent. Cannot transfer assets to avoid existing creditors. Most states have a 4-year lookback for fraudulent transfers.

Discretionary distributions are better than mandatory ones. If beneficiaries have no legal right to demand distributions, creditors generally can't force them either.

Spendthrift clauses should be included. These prevent beneficiaries from assigning their interests and prevent creditors from reaching trust assets.

Offshore trusts (established in jurisdictions like Cook Islands, Nevis, or Belize) provide additional protection because foreign courts don't automatically enforce U.S. judgments. However, offshore trusts are expensive, complex, and require strict IRS reporting.

Domestic asset protection trusts are available in certain states (Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota, etc.) that allow self-settled trusts (where the trustor is also a beneficiary) with creditor protection.

## Page 13 - Using Trusts for Business and Commerce

Express Trusts can operate businesses and engage in commerce just like individuals or corporations. This provides unique advantages.

A business trust structure separates business operations from personal liability. The trust owns the business, the trustee manages it, and beneficiaries receive profits. If the business faces lawsuits or liabilities, only trust assets are at risk, not the trustee's or beneficiaries' personal assets.

Trusts can enter contracts in the trust's name. For example, "HEINZ WOLFGANG EXPRESS TRUST, by Heinz Wolfgang, Trustee" would be the contracting party. This keeps the trustee's personal name separate from the contract.

Trusts can own LLCs or corporations. This creates a multi-layer structure: the trust is the owner, the LLC/corporation is the operating entity, and the trustee controls both. This provides liability protection at multiple levels.

Trusts can hold intellectual property—patents, copyrights, trademarks. This protects these valuable assets and allows for licensing and royalty arrangements.

Trusts can own real estate and engage in real estate business. Buy, sell, develop, lease—all in the trust name.

For state nationals, operating business through a trust rather than as a sole proprietor or under personal name maintains privacy and separation from the public person (U.S. citizen). The trust operates in commerce while the natural person remains private.

## Page 14 - Trust Privacy and Confidentiality

One of the most valuable benefits of Express Trusts is privacy. Unlike corporations and LLCs that must file public documents with the state, private Express Trusts generally do not require public filing or disclosure.

The Declaration of Trust is a private document. It doesn't have to be filed with any government agency. Only the parties to the trust need copies. This means the public cannot easily discover who created the trust, who the beneficiaries are, or what assets it holds.

When the trust owns real estate, the deed is recorded and public. However, it only shows the trust name and trustee, not the beneficiaries or beneficial owner. Someone researching property ownership sees "HEINZ WOLFGANG EXPRESS TRUST" but not necessarily who benefits from the trust.

Financial institutions require documentation to open trust accounts, but this information remains confidential (subject to subpoena or court order). The general public cannot access it.

Trust tax returns (Form 1041) are filed with the IRS but are not public records. Unlike corporate tax returns which can sometimes be obtained, trust returns are private.

This privacy is valuable for many reasons: reduces risk of frivolous lawsuits (nobody knows what you have), prevents targeting by criminals or scammers, maintains business confidentiality, and keeps family financial matters private.

However, privacy is not the same as secrecy for illegal purposes. Trusts must still comply with tax reporting, anti-money-laundering rules, and court orders. The privacy is for legitimate purposes, not for hiding criminal activity.

## Page 15 - The Temple Concept and Spiritual Trusts

Within certain religious and philosophical movements, trusts are viewed not just as legal entities but as spiritual temples—places of worship and spiritual practice protected by the First Amendment's free exercise clause.

The Temple Trust concept holds that: the trustor is creating a temple for spiritual purposes, the trust property is dedicated to divine or spiritual purposes, the trustee is a spiritual steward or minister, and beneficiaries are members of the spiritual community.

This structure claims additional constitutional protection under the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

Churches and religious organizations have historically received special treatment under U.S. law: exemption from income tax (IRC §501(c)(3)), exemption from unemployment tax, exemption from certain reporting requirements, privacy of donor information, and protection from government interference in religious matters.

Some promoters claim that calling an Express Trust a "Temple Trust" or "Ministry Trust" provides these same benefits. They argue the trust is engaged in spiritual ministry and therefore tax-exempt and beyond government regulation.

The IRS and courts have generally rejected these claims unless the trust is genuinely engaged in recognized religious activity. Simply calling something a temple or ministry doesn't make it tax-exempt. There must be actual religious purpose, activity, and substance.

However, legitimate religious trusts that actually support ministry, provide for clergy, maintain places of worship, and serve spiritual communities can receive tax-exempt status and First Amendment protection.

## Page 16 - The Declaration of Express Trust Document

The actual Declaration of Trust document should be comprehensive and carefully drafted. While trust forms are available, custom drafting by a knowledgeable attorney is preferable.

Key sections of the declaration include:

Preamble: Statement of the trustor's intent to create the trust and dedication of property to trust purposes.

Article I - Name and Definitions: Official name of the trust and definitions of key terms used throughout.

## Page 17 - Common Mistakes in Trust Creation and Operation

Many people create trusts but fail to receive the intended benefits due to common mistakes:

Failure to Fund: Creating the trust declaration but never transferring property into it. An empty trust provides no benefits. All intended trust property must be properly retitled and transferred.

Inadequate Separation: Trustor continues to act as if they own the property, commingling trust and personal funds, using trust property for personal purposes without proper documentation. This can cause courts to ignore the trust as a sham.

Poor Recordkeeping: Not maintaining separate books and records for the trust, failing to document decisions and transactions, missing required tax filings. This creates liability and evidentiary problems.

Improper Distributions: Making distributions that violate trust terms, failing to document distributions, treating distributions as loans or vice versa. This can cause tax problems and breach of fiduciary duty.

Excessive Trustor Control: If the trustor retains too much control, the IRS can classify the trust as a grantor trust and tax all income to the trustor, defeating tax benefits.

Ignoring Formalities: Treating the trust casually, not having regular trustee meetings or resolutions, not following trust terms. This weakens the trust's legal standing.

Failing to Update: Not reviewing and updating the trust as laws change, family circumstances change, or assets change. Trusts should be reviewed every 3-5 years.

Using Trust for Fraud: Transferring assets to trust to avoid existing creditors, hiding income, evading taxes. This is fraudulent and can result in the trust being voided and criminal prosecution.

The key is to treat the trust as a real entity with genuine separation from the trustor, following all formalities, and using it for legitimate purposes.

## Page 18 - Integrating Trusts with State National Status

For those who have claimed state national status (as discussed in Chapter 7), the Express Trust provides a vehicle for operating in commerce while maintaining separation from federal U.S. citizen status.

The strategy is: the natural person (state national) creates the trust but is not the trustee or primary beneficiary. The trust operates in commerce, conducts business, owns property. The trust has its own EIN and files its own tax returns. The natural person receives benefits from the trust as a beneficiary but maintains private status.

This creates a division between the public (trust engaging in commerce) and the private (natural person living life). The trust interacts with the commercial world while the natural person remains separate.

For business purposes, the trust can: obtain business licenses, open bank accounts, enter contracts, employ workers, pay taxes, own property, and engage in all commercial activity.

The state national can: serve as trust beneficiary, provide services to the trust under contract, maintain private non-commercial status, avoid direct commercial entanglements that might compromise national status.

Documents to support this structure include: Declaration of Trust establishing the trust, Certificate of Trust for presenting to third parties, Operating Agreement or Procedures for trust administration, Beneficial Interest Certificate showing beneficiary status, Service Agreements between the trust and the natural person.

This structure must be genuine, not a sham. The trust must have real purpose and substance. It must file required tax returns and comply with applicable laws. The separation between trust and natural person must be maintained consistently.

## Page 19 - The W-8BEN Form and Foreign Status

For state nationals operating through trusts, the IRS Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for United States Tax Treaty Benefits) has been promoted as a way to claim foreign status and avoid U.S. taxation.

Form W-8BEN is legitimately used by actual foreign persons to claim they are not U.S. persons for tax purposes and to claim treaty benefits if applicable. Banks and payers use this form to determine whether to withhold U.S. taxes.

Some in the state national movement file W-8BEN claiming they are "non-resident aliens" not subject to U.S. taxation. They argue that as state nationals rather than U.S. citizens, they are "foreign" to the federal United States and can file this form.

The IRS strongly disagrees. IRS guidance and court cases make clear that U.S. citizens and residents cannot use Form W-8BEN. Filing it falsely can result in penalties and criminal charges.

The confusion arises from multiple definitions of "United States" in different contexts: geographic (50 states), political (federal government), and tax law (federal zone plus wherever federal taxation applies). State nationals argue they're outside the tax law definition. The IRS says anyone born in the 50 states is a U.S. person for tax purposes.

For trusts, Form W-8BEN might be legitimately used if the trust is a foreign trust (not meeting the U.S. control and court tests). However, most Express Trusts created by people living in the states will be domestic trusts that cannot use Form W-8BEN.

The safer approach is proper tax planning within the system rather than attempting to opt out entirely through questionable form filings.

## Page 20 - Trust Maintenance and Administration

Once created, a trust requires ongoing administration to remain valid and effective.

Annual trustee responsibilities include: holding annual trustee meeting (document with minutes), reviewing trust assets and performance, making distribution decisions, filing tax returns (Form 1041 by April 15 or March 15 if fiscal year), providing accounting to beneficiaries, reviewing and updating trust investments, ensuring insurance coverage is adequate, and maintaining trust records and documentation.

The trust should maintain: separate bank account(s) in trust name, separate books and records, file of all trust documents, asset inventory updated regularly, and documentation of all transactions.

Major trust events requiring attention: change of trustee (requires resignation and acceptance documents), sale or purchase of trust property (proper documentation and authorization), distributions to beneficiaries (document amount, date, purpose), loans to or from the trust (proper loan agreements), and changes in beneficiary status (marriage, death, birth of children).

Regular trust reviews should examine: whether trust terms still serve the intended purposes, whether trustee is performing duties adequately, whether beneficiary needs have changed, whether tax law changes affect the trust, whether asset protection is adequate, and whether amendments or restatement might be beneficial.

Proper administration ensures the trust continues to provide intended benefits and withstands challenges from creditors, tax authorities, or family disputes.

## Page 21 - Trust Disputes and Resolution

Despite careful planning, trust disputes can arise. Common sources include: beneficiaries claiming trustee is breaching duties, beneficiaries disputing distribution decisions, questions about trust interpretation, claims that trust is invalid or was created through fraud/undue influence, and conflicts between current and remainder beneficiaries.

Resolution mechanisms include:

Internal Resolution: The trust terms may include dispute resolution procedures such as mediation or arbitration requirements.

Trustee Discretion: Many disputes involve discretionary decisions (how much to distribute, which investments to make). If the trustee acts reasonably and within the trust terms, courts generally defer to trustee discretion.

Court Intervention: Beneficiaries can petition the court for interpretation of trust terms, accounting from the trustee, removal of the trustee, or damages for breach of duty.

Mediation: Many trust disputes can be resolved through mediation, which is faster and less expensive than litigation.

To minimize disputes: clearly draft trust terms, maintain transparent communication with beneficiaries, document all significant decisions, provide regular accountings, treat beneficiaries fairly, and seek professional advice on difficult decisions.

When disputes arise: respond promptly to beneficiary concerns, document the facts and legal basis for decisions, consult with attorney if litigation seems likely, consider mediation before court proceedings, and maintain professional demeanor even if beneficiaries are emotional.

Trustees can be held personally liable for breaches of duty, so taking disputes seriously and handling them properly is essential.

## Page 22 - Advanced Trust Strategies

For sophisticated planners, multiple trusts can be used together for different purposes:

Family Trust holds family residence and personal assets for family use.

Business Trust owns business interests and commercial property.

Dynasty Trust holds investments for multiple generations.

Charitable Trust supports charitable purposes while providing income to family.

Insurance Trust holds life insurance policies outside the estate.

Asset Protection Trust in favorable jurisdiction (domestic or offshore) holds high-risk assets.

This multi-trust structure provides: compartmentalization of risks, specialized management for different assets, flexibility to achieve multiple goals, and enhanced asset protection.

Trusts can also be combined with other entities: Trust owns LLC which owns operating business. Trust owns corporation which conducts commercial activities. Trust holds partnership interests in real estate ventures.

These layered structures provide liability protection at multiple levels, tax planning flexibility, and privacy enhancement.

The key is having a coherent overall plan rather than randomly creating multiple trusts. Each should have a clear purpose and fit into the comprehensive estate and asset protection plan.

## Page 23 - Trusts and Estate Planning

Express Trusts are powerful estate planning tools that can: avoid probate (trust property transfers per trust terms without court process), maintain privacy (no public probate proceedings), reduce estate taxes (properly structured trusts remove assets from taxable estate), provide for incapacity (successor trustee takes over if trustor becomes incapacitated), control asset distribution (can specify exactly when and how beneficiaries receive property), and protect beneficiaries (can include spendthrift provisions protecting against creditors and beneficiary's own poor decisions).

Estate planning trusts include:

Revocable Living Trust: Holds assets during life, avoids probate at death, provides for incapacity.

Testamentary Trust: Created by will, takes effect at death, provides for minor children or special needs beneficiaries.

Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust: Owns life insurance, keeps death benefit outside taxable estate.

Qualified Personal Residence Trust: Transfers residence to trust, removes value from estate while allowing continued use.

Generation-Skipping Trust: Provides for children during life, then passes to grandchildren, avoiding double taxation.

The specific structures depend on individual circumstances including: size of estate, family composition, tax concerns, asset protection needs, and desire for control vs. tax benefits.

Professional estate planning advice is essential for estates over $1 million or with complex family situations, business interests, or asset protection concerns.

## Page 24 - The Future of Trusts and Trust Law

Trust law continues to evolve. Current trends include:

Increasing State Competition: States compete for trust business by enacting favorable laws. Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota, and Alaska offer particularly advantageous trust statutes including asset protection, perpetual trusts, and favorable tax treatment.

Perpetual Trusts: The traditional Rule Against Perpetuities (limiting trust duration to lives in being plus 21 years) has been abolished in many states, allowing dynasty trusts that can last centuries.

Directed Trusts: Allow separation of trustee functions—one trustee manages investments, another handles distributions, a third holds assets. This specialization improves trust management.

Decanting: Allows trustees to pour assets from one trust into another with better terms, essentially amending an irrevocable trust without court approval.

Virtual Representation: Allows certain beneficiaries to represent others (like unborn beneficiaries) in trust matters, reducing the need for court involvement.

Digital Assets: Trust law is adapting to address cryptocurrency, digital accounts, social media, and other electronic property.

Privacy Concerns: As government surveillance and data collection increase, trusts provide one of the few remaining privacy tools.

For state nationals and those seeking maximum freedom, Express Trusts remain the most powerful legal tool available. They provide constitutional protection, asset protection, tax planning flexibility, privacy, and a vehicle for operating in commerce while maintaining separation from government control.

The key is proper education, careful planning, correct implementation, and consistent operation. A well-structured Express Trust can provide benefits for generations and protect family wealth and freedom through changing times and political circumstances.

## Page 25 - Conclusion: The Integrated Strategy

Chapters 5 through 8 have presented a comprehensive strategy for financial and legal freedom:

Chapter 5 demonstrated how to eradicate public debt through use of lawful money and non-negotiable instruments, shifting the burden of Federal Reserve notes back to the United States government where it belongs.

Chapter 6 provided practical credit, banking, and investment knowledge to build wealth within the system while understanding how money actually works.

Chapter 7 explained the distinction between nationality and citizenship and the process of reclaiming state national status.

Chapter 8 showed how Express Trusts provide the legal structure for protecting assets, maintaining privacy, and operating in commerce as a natural person.

These four elements work together synergistically:

State national status establishes political identity separate from federal citizenship.

Express Trust provides the vehicle for operating in commerce while maintaining private status.

Lawful money usage discharges public debt and reduces federal obligations.

Credit and investment knowledge builds wealth that is then protected in the trust structure.

The integrated strategy is: Establish state national status through proper declaration and documentation. Create an Express Trust to hold assets and conduct business. Transfer assets into the trust following proper procedures. Operate consistently with the chosen status—use lawful money, maintain separation between public and private, act as natural person not federal citizen. Build wealth through sound financial principles. Protect that wealth through trust structure and asset protection strategies. Pass wealth to future generations through properly structured estate planning.

This is not a quick fix or magic solution. It requires education, commitment, proper implementation, and consistent operation. But for those willing to invest the time and effort, it provides a pathway to genuine financial and legal freedom within the American constitutional system.

The choice is individual. Continue operating as a federal U.S. citizen under federal jurisdiction with all associated obligations, or reclaim the original American birthright as a state national operating in private trust with maximum freedom and protection.

Either way, understanding these concepts provides knowledge that empowers informed decisions about how to structure life, protect assets, and relate to government. That knowledge itself is valuable regardless of which specific strategies one chooses to implement.

The journey toward freedom begins with education. This book has provided the foundation. The next step is individual study, research, consultation with knowledgeable advisors, and careful planning. The tools are available. The law is there. The question is simply whether one will use them.

As Thomas Jefferson wrote: "Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual."

The path forward is clear for those with eyes to see and courage to walk it. May this knowledge serve you well in the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness—the unalienable rights that are your birthright as a natural person and American national.
