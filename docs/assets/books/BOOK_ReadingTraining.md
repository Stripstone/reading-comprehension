# Triforce Reading Method — Page Breakdown

---

## Page 1 — The Problem & Promise

Imagine if you could finish a book in one day, instead of spending months reading the same book and never making progress.

I’m Salim, a med student, and I’ve had to read hundreds of books through med school, undergrad, and my masters. I never wanted to spend hours reading every day like most people, because I wanted time for things I actually cared about.

Over the years, I found the three best strategies you need to massively increase your reading speed, which I call the Triforce Method.

## Page 2 — Strategy 1: Remove the Internal Monologue

The first strategy is improving your baseline reading speed by removing your internal monologue — the voice in your head when you read.

I used a free website called Spreeder to help with this. The idea is that your internal monologue limits you to reading one word at a time, which caps your speed.

To read faster, you need to see words instead of hearing them. You already do this in daily life — for example, when you see a stop sign, you don’t sound out the word “STOP,” you just process it visually.

---

## Page 3 — Speed Reading Tools & Results

Websites like Spreeder let you control words per minute or group words together so you don’t give your internal voice time to activate.

Your eyes are fast enough to still understand the text, even if it feels weird at first. After a day, it starts to feel normal.

Using this method, I increased my reading speed by at least 50%. I started at around 250 words per minute and can now read over 500 words per minute even without tools.

## Page 4 — Visual Tracking to Prevent Backtracking

The last part of the first strategy is using a visual tracker.

When you read with just your eyes, your eye movement is jittery, causing micro-adjustments and backtracking. This wastes time, especially at higher reading speeds.

Using a finger or pen as a tracker keeps your eyes moving smoothly and prevents you from going backward. Over time, increasing the tracker speed can raise your reading speed by another 100 words per minute.

## Page 5 — Strategy 2: Reading Strategy & the 80/20 Rule

The second strategy is having a reading strategy — knowing when and how to use speed-reading techniques.

About 80% of knowledge comes from 20% of a non-fiction book. This understanding saved me a lot of time.

For books like *Atomic Habits*, most pages are examples supporting a small amount of useful advice. I sped through most pages using speed techniques and slowed down only when I found valuable insights.

## Page 6 — Adapting Speed for Comprehension

When I found a key idea, I slowed down to absorb it properly. Reading at 700 words per minute lowers comprehension compared to slowing down to 500.

Adapting your reading speed depending on content helps you focus on what matters instead of absorbing unnecessary details.

Trying to remember everything is like highlighting every sentence — it doesn’t help.

---

## Page 7 — Strategy 3: Summarising & Retention

None of this matters if you don’t remember what you read.

Many people say they read books but can’t summarize the last chapter they read. If that feels uncomfortable, it’s because it’s true.

The third and final strategy is summarising and consolidating. There’s no point reading a lot if you don’t understand it.

---

## Page 8 — Page-Level Summaries

At the end of every page, summarise it in one or two lines.

Even if nothing important was said, “nothing important” counts as a summary. This forces engagement and improves retention.

This technique helped me score in the top 1% on my medical school admissions exam by quickly extracting relevant information.

---

## Page 9 — Consolidation Through Action

Beyond summarising, you need to consolidate by taking action, especially for non-fiction books.

For example, *Atomic Habits* suggests tracking habits — so I actually did that instead of just reading about it.

I would stop reading until I took action for at least a day, because learning means changing behavior. If nothing changes, you haven’t actually learned.

## Page 10 — Closing & Context

There’s a difference between reading for learning and reading for enjoyment, like fiction or poetry.

But one area where speed and technique always help is typing.

In another video, I explain how to triple your typing speed in seven days and encourage viewers to consolidate learning by taking action.
