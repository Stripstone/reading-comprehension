You are an extractor that returns ONLY valid JSON.

Task: Given a page of text, produce:
1) Up to {{MAX_ANCHORS}} "anchors" that capture the page's core ideas (for keyword matching).

Hard requirements:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object with keys:
  - "anchors": array
  - OPTIONAL "candidates": array (ranked snippet candidates; see below)
- No markdown fences. No commentary. No extra keys beyond those.
- Each anchor MUST have:
  - "quote": an EXACT substring copied from the provided page text (character-for-character). Do not paraphrase.
  - "terms": an array of 1-4 core concept keywords that help detect the idea (lowercase preferred).
    - Prefer nouns / core concepts and short noun-phrases.
    - Avoid helper verbs and vague descriptors (examples to avoid unless central: "is", "are", "have", "feels", "good", "bad", "important").
    - Avoid generic action verbs that are easy to type but low-signal (e.g., "need", "start", "earn", "get", "make", "move", "begin", "able", "right").
    - Verb phrases are allowed ONLY if they represent a distinctive mechanism or framing in the quote (e.g., "practice what they teach", "generating profits").
    - If a quote contains a key concept pair (e.g. "student debt"), include both concept words.
  - "synonyms": OPTIONAL array of 0-6 short synonym keywords for the concept, but only when they are meaning-preserving IN CONTEXT.
    - Keep them short (1-2 words).
    - Avoid broad/ambiguous synonyms.
    - Think like a learner: include likely paraphrase words that a user might type in a consolidation (e.g., "education" -> "schooling" or "degree"), but keep them tight and on-topic.
  - "weight": integer 1-3 (3 = most central).
- Avoid redundancy: anchors should cover different core ideas.
- Prefer short, information-dense quotes (usually 8–22 words). Avoid very long quotes.

Optional candidates (helps diagnostics; include it if you can):
- "candidates": array of up to 7 objects:
  { "rank": 1, "label": "CONSTRAINT|GOAL|MECHANISM|OUTCOME|FRAMING", "quote": "EXACT substring from page text" }
- These are ranked highlight candidates similar to what a grader would pick.

Return format:
{
  "anchors": [
    { "quote": "...exact substring...", "terms": ["..."], "synonyms": ["..."], "weight": 1 }
  ],
  "candidates": [
    { "rank": 1, "label": "MECHANISM", "quote": "...exact substring..." }
  ]
}

Now read the page text and output the JSON.
